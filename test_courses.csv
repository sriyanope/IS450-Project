For the past 150 years, more and more people have gained access to energy, primarily in the form of fossil fuels – coal, petroleum and natural gas. But now, even while half of humanity cannot access adequate energy supplies, we are beginning a profound transition to more diverse energy sources. Climate change, environmental sustainability, and energy poverty are all important – and sometimes conflicting – drivers as we strive to supply more energy to more people with fewer negative impacts on Earth’s environments. 
In this course from the University of Alberta and Canadian Society for Evolving Energy, you will join us to learn about the many energy sources available, and where technology is providing exciting new solutions to energy and environmental challenges. Find out what roles energy storage must play to support the transition, and discuss how we can optimize transition processes. Examine competing viewpoints (“realities”) to enable energy transition, focusing on the practical challenges in bringing about change on a global basis. Finally, you will bring all these issues together to examine how the energy transition process is progressing and what we must do to create pathways to achieve our goals.

You’ll start by learning the nuances of working with 2D and 3D medical image data. You’ll then apply tree-based models to improve patient survival estimates. You’ll also use data from randomized trials to recommend treatments more suited to individual patients. Finally, you’ll explore how natural language extraction can more efficiently label medical datasets.

Imagine being able to analyze data on patient visits to the clinic, medications prescribed, lab tests, and procedures performed, as well as data outside the health system -- such as social media, purchases made using credit cards, census records, Internet search activity logs that contain valuable health information, and you’ll get a sense of how AI could transform patient care and diagnoses.
In this specialization, we'll discuss the current and future applications of AI in healthcare with the goal of learning to bring AI technologies into the clinic safely and ethically.  
This specialization is designed for both healthcare providers and computer science professionals, offering insights to facilitate collaboration between the disciplines.
CME Accreditation
The Stanford University School of Medicine is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education (ACCME) to provide continuing medical education for physicians.  View the full CME accreditation information on the individual course FAQ page.
Applied Learning Project
The final course will consist of a capstone project that will take you on a guided tour exploring all the concepts we have covered in the different classes. This will be a hands-on experience following a patient's journey from the lens of the data, using a unique dataset created for this specialization.We will review how the different choices you make -- such as those around feature construction, the data types to use, how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline -- affect the care that would be recommended by the model.
