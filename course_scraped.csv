0,Agile Meets Design Thinking,4,How to evaluate and explain the relevance of concepts and practices from the agile development methodologies;How to create a strong shared perspective and drive to value using design methods like personas and problem scenarios;How to diagnose what software will be valuable to the user and how to test your ideas using agile user stories and prototypes;How to facilitate narrative collaboration with user stories and prototypes,Software Engineering,"Despite everyone's good intentions, hard work and solid ideas, too many teams end up creating products that no one wants, no one can use, and no one buys. But it doesn't have to be this way. Agile and design thinking offer a different--and effective--approach to product development, one that results in valuable solutions to meaningful problems. In this course, you’ll learn how to determine what's valuable to a user early in the process--to frontload value--by focusing your team on testable narratives about the user and creating a strong shared perspective. ;This course is supported by the Batten Institute at UVA’s Darden School of Business.

Twitter is full of jokes about how teams say they do agile but don’t ‘really’ do it. The reality is that getting the most out of agile is less about observing specific procedures and more about how a team focuses and measures their progress. ;Rather than just boring you with an accounting of agile methodologies, this course focuses on helping you better charter your team’s focus, definition of success, and practice of agile. While learning about agile mainstays like Scrum, XP, and kanban, you’ll also learn to help your team ask the right questions about how they’re working and facilitate good answers on how agile can help.
