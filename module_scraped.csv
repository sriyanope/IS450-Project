This week, we’ll identify what’s hard about creating excellent products and how agile can help. We'll begin with a discussion of the Agile Manifesto- what motivated it and how it defines agile. Then we’ll get into the practical part- the problems agile solves, how to focus your time and energy, and how you’ll know if your practice of agile is working.",Why is Agile?;What is Agile?;What is Design? ;Your Agile Journey;Agile for Managers;Agile for Individual Contributors;Agile 101;Today's Best Practices;Scale Friendly vs. Innovation Friendly;What Makes Agile Hard;The Blue Button Moment;Culture of Experimentation;The Manifesto in Practice;A Hypothesis-Driven Approach to Agile;Greg Cohen on Getting Started with Agile;Bill Wake on Getting Started with Agile;How We Learn
https://www.coursera.org/learn/uva-darden-getting-started-agile,"Focusing Your Agile with Personas, Jobs-to-be-Done, and Alternatives","The best way to avoid building something nobody wants is to start with somebody in mind. In the design world, we talk about that ""somebody"" through a ‘persona’. Personas and problem scenarios (aka 'jobs-to-be-done') focus development on driving toward a valuable outcome for your user vs. just generating output. In this module, you’ll learn to focus your work by developing personas, problem scenarios, and alternatives using best practices from design thinking.","Design Thinking for Agile User Stories;Meet the Companies: HVAC in a Hurry and Enable Quiz;Creating and Using Personas;Focusing Your Persona: Think, See, Feel, Do;Demo: Using the Hypothesis-Driven Development Template (UPDATE);Demo: Drafting Personas;Demo: Drafting Think, See, Feel, Do;Creating User Stories that Matter;Skit: Meet the HVAC in a Hurry Team;Skit: Dani's Meeting with the CEO"

This might sound simple or obvious, but I think after this week it’s likely you’ll find opportunities to help improve your team’s focus by testing ideas more definitively before you invest in developing software. In this module, you’ll learn how to make concept testing an integral part of your product pipeline. We’ll continue to apply methods from Lean Startup, looking at how they pair with agile.
