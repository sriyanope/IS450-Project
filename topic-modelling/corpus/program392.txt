handson internet of things
this is intended for technologically minded persons who are interested in getting to know the latest in ubiquitous computing also known as internet of things the consists of courses that are composed of a basic part with lectures and quizzes and a practical honors part which includes physically assembling and implementing functionality atop a networked device please note while the honors part of the courses is optional it is required to purchase hardware to complete these practical parts of the courses the courses are meant to be taken in sequence as each builds on the previous one while adding more functions to the device in the honors section the construction of the device introduces realworld challenges and technological approaches commonly encountered in the iot industry and builds students confidence that they can do things for real

learners will be introduced to the concepts and technologies in internet of things in the optional honors section build an actual small selfdriving vehicle using networking and sensor technologies throughout the honors parts of the four courses the vehicle will become more refined gaining capabilities such as environmental sensing computer vision autonomous driving cloudbased analytics and more again we need to mention that a prerequisite to complete this part of the courses is a basic kit of hardware that you need to purchase if you dont want to complete the honors parts you dont need the hardware
