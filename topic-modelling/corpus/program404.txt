<DOC>sentiment in text
the first step in understanding sentiment in text and in particular when training a neural network to do so is the tokenization of that text this is the process of converting the text into numeric values with a number representing a word or a character about the tokenizer and padsequences apis in tensorflow and how they can be used to prepare and encode text and sentences to get them ready for training neural networks
introduction a conversation with andrew ng introduction word based encodings using apis notebook for lesson text to sequence padding outofvocabulary words notebook for lesson sarcasm really preprocessing the sarcasm dataset notebook for lesson wrap up
</DOC>

<DOC>word embeddings
last you saw how to use the tokenizer to prepare your text to be used by a neural network by converting words into numeric tokens and sequencing sentences from these tokens about embeddings where these tokens are mapped as vectors in a high dimension space with embeddings and labelled examples these vectors can then be tuned so that words with similar meaning will have a similar direction in the vector space this will begin the process of training a neural network to understand sentiment in text and begin by looking at movie reviews training a neural network on texts that are labelled positive or negative and determining which words in a sentence drive those meanings
a conversation with andrew ng introduction the imdb dataset looking into the details how can we use vectors more into the details notebook for lesson remember the sarcasm dataset building a classifier for the sarcasm dataset lets talk about the loss subword tokenization diving into the code
</DOC>

<DOC>sequence models
in the last couple of weeks you looked first at tokenizing words to get numeric values from them and then using embeddings to group words of similar meaning depending on how they were labelled this gave you a good but rough sentiment analysis words such as fun and entertaining might show up in a positive movie review and boring and dull might show up in a negative one but sentiment can also be determined by the sequence in which words appear for example you could have not fun which of is the opposite of fun start digging into a variety of model formats that are used in training models to understand context in sequence
a conversation with andrew ng introduction lstms implementing lstms in code accuracy and loss a word from laurence looking into the code using a convolutional network going back to the imdb dataset tips from laurence
</DOC>

<DOC>sequence models and literature
taking everything that youve learned in training a neural network based on nlp we thought it might be a bit of fun to turn the tables away from classification and use your knowledge for prediction given a body of words you could conceivably predict the word most likely to follow a given word or phrase and once youve done that to do it again and again with that in mind build a poetry generator its trained with the lyrics from traditional irish songs and can be used to produce beautifulsounding verse of its own
a conversation with andrew ng introduction looking into the code preparing the training data more on the training data finding what the next word should be example predicting a word notebook for lesson poetry looking into the code laurence the poet your next task a conversation with andrew ng

<DOC>exploring a larger dataset
in the first you had an introduction to tensorflow and how with its high level apis you could do basic image classification and you learned a little bit about convolutional neural networks convnets go deeper into using convnets with realworld data and about techniques that you can use to improve your convnet performance particularly when doing image classification in get started by looking at a much larger dataset than youve been using thus far the cats and dogs dataset which had been a kaggle challenge in image classification
introduction a conversation with andrew ng a conversation with andrew ng training with the cats vs dogs dataset working through the notebook fixing through cropping visualizing the effect of the convolutions looking at accuracy and loss wrap up
</DOC>

<DOC>augmentation a technique to avoid overfitting
youve heard the term overfitting a number of times to this point overfitting is simply the concept of being over specialized in training namely that your model is very good at classifying what it is trained for but not so good at classifying things that it hasnt seen in order to generalize your model more effectively of need a greater breadth of samples to train it on thats not always possible but a nice potential shortcut to this is image augmentation where you tweak the training set to potentially increase the diversity of subjects it covers all about that
a conversation with andrew ng introducing augmentation coding augmentation with the layers api demonstrating overfitting in cats vs dogs adding augmentation to cats vs dogs exploring augmentation with horses vs humans wrap up
</DOC>

<DOC>transfer learning
building models for yourself is great and can be very powerful but as youve seen you can be limited by the data you have on hand not everybody has access to massive datasets or the compute power thats needed to train them effectively transfer learning can help solve this where people with models trained on large datasets train them so that you can either use them directly or you can use the features that they have learned and apply them to your scenario this is transfer learning and look into that

<DOC>multiclass classifications
youve come a long way congratulations one more thing to do before we move off of convnets to the next and thats to go beyond binary classification each of the examples youve done so far involved classifying one thing or another horse or human cat or dog when moving beyond binary into categorical classification there are some coding considerations you need to take into account look at them
