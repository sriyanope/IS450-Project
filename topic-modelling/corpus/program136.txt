excelvba for creative problem solving
this is for learners wishing to dramatically change the way that they use excel spreadsheets by unleashing the power to automate and optimize spreadsheets using visual basic for applications vba the first two courses will teach learners the basics of vba through the use of dozens of educational screencasts and a series of quizzes and inapplication programming finally in part of the learners will complete real world and somewhat open ended projects which are graded through peer review

learners will complete one easy project chosen from two potential projects one intermediate project chosen from two potential projects and a third required monte carlo simulation project intermediate in difficulty projects include realtime currency converter geography toolbox ultimate organizer regression toolbox monte carlo simulation and grade manager

excelvba for creative problem solving part
excelvba for creative problem solving part is aimed at learners who are seeking to augment expand optimize and increase the efficiency of their excel spreadsheet by tapping into the powerful programming automation and customization capabilities available with visual basic for applications vba
this is the first part of a threepart series and that focuses on the application of computing techniques in excelvba to solve problems part create macros to automate procedures in excel
define your own userdefined functions
create basic subroutines to interface with the user
the basic programming structures in vba
and automate excels goal seek and solver tools and use numerical techniques to create live solutions to solve targeting and optimization problems new to computer programming the extremely intuitive and visual nature of vba lends itself nicely to teaching and learning what a fun way to to code no prior knowledge in programming nor advanced math are necessary yet seasoned programmers will pick up new and creative spreadsheet problem solving strategies after you have learned the basics of vba each will introduce foundational and broad problems inspired by situations that you might encounter in the real world to pass each need to pass a mastery quiz and complete a problem solving this is unique in that the weekly are completed inapplication ie on your own computer in excel providing you with valuable handson training

macro recording vba procedures and debugging
will introduce you to visual basic for applications vba and teach you the foundational tools required to create basic procedures in vba about different data types and the scope of variables how to troubleshoot your code when its not working and how to record basic macros using both absolute and relative referencing modes
welcome what can you do with excelvba how the works how to switch sessions of the preview getting your feet wet saving your files as macroenabled workbooks recording basic macros absolute vs relative referencing during macro recording of procedures in vba why use option explicit declaration of variables data types and scope of variables how to troubleshoot when your code is not working properly preview and instructions

vba nuts bolts part
in how to write proper vba syntax and basic mathematical expressions about objects properties methods and events and how to borrow common excel functions using vba code in addition how to move information to and from excel and the visual basic editor vbe
preview vba syntax and expression entry part vba syntax and expression entry part a warning about exponentiation and ampersands introduction to objects properties methods and events common objects properties and methods how to borrow functions from excel examples part basic input and output in subroutines examples part basic input and output in subroutines examples part basic input and output in subroutines preview and instructions

vba nuts bolts part
in how to create your own userdefined functions also how to call other subroutines and functions that reside in other files and how to design subroutines based on a modular approach finally basic error handling in vba
preview how to make your own userdefined function how to convert a userdefined function to an excel addin how to troubleshoot your user defined functions why you dont use input and message boxes in functions how to handle basic user error in your subroutines an introduction to modular programming running a subroutine that resides in another file preview and instructions

programming structures in vba
begins the meat of programming in vba and we are finally moving into some exciting problem solving about the common programming structures in vba sequence selection and repetition that form the foundation for advanced programming procedures several examples will highlight the utility of these programming structures
preview how to implement oneway ifthen selection structures how to implement twoway ifthen selection structures all about the multialternative ifthen variable iteration loops doloops validating user input using a doloop creating a guessing game using a doloop all about fixed iteration fornext loops iterating through a selection vs a range putting it all together example putting it all together example example highlighting max and min values in a range using the for each next statement worked miniproject searching through high and low temperatures in an excel workbook preview and instructions

data management using vba
one of the most valuable uses of vba is to manage large data sets in excel how to automate the processes of filtering sorting and removing duplicates additional strategies for cleaning up data the strategies learned will make you a valued vba user
preview filtering basics filtering for multiple criteria part filtering for multiple criteria part highlighting or deleting rows that satisfy a certain criterion sorting basics removing duplicates example removing duplicates putting it all together cleaning data preview and instructions

rc style
the final of this focuses on using the rc style of cell formatting this style in contrast to the default a style of referencing in excel makes it much easier and straightforward to perform advanced manipulations to excel worksheets several examples demonstrate the utility of the rc style
preview when macro recording fails what is rc style the cells property the resize property example rc style example rc style preview and instructions

excelvba for creative problem solving part
excelvba for creative problem solving part builds off of knowledge and obtained in excelvba for creative problem solving part and is aimed at learners who are seeking to augment expand optimize and increase the efficiency of their excel spreadsheet by tapping into the powerful programming automation and customization capabilities available with visual basic for applications vba
in part of the learners will how to with arrays and importexport arrays fromto excel using vba code
how to with text strings and write data to txt files and import information from txt files
automate the import modification and consolidation of information from multiple worksheets into a central worksheet as as the import of information from multiple workbooks to a central workbook
and gain with creating user forms to interface with the user perform advanced calculations and manipulate data on the spreadsheet learners who have a foundational understanding of vba code and programming structures can jump right into part of the without taking part and use the screencasts in part as reference each will introduce foundational and broad problems inspired by situations that you might encounter in the real world to pass each need to pass a mastery quiz and complete a problem solving this is unique in that the weekly are completed inapplication ie on your own computer in excel providing you with valuable handson training

arrays and array functions
in all about arrays and array functions how to iterate through arrays using nested fornext loops and for eachnext statements how to import data to vba from excel and export data to excel from vba how to create userdefined array functions and about the redim preserve statement for resizable arrays is concluded with a quiz which unlocks
what how the works how to switch sessions of the introduction to arrays local arrays in vba importingexporting arrays fromto excel using arrays in subroutines and functions userdefined array functions example sortvector array function and ksmallest example extracting diagonal elements from a square matrix example residuals of simple linear regression redim preserve example redim preserve preview and instructions
