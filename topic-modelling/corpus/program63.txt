science and engineering of climate change
global warming is one of the most significant challenges of the century and tackling it in the most effective way requires a good understanding of its physical social and financial aspects the science and engineering of climate change offers an introduction to the science of climate change and to the existing technologies to mitigate its effects
are we sure that the climate is changing how confident are we that climate change is anthropogenic are we heading for a climate catastrophe why are greenhouse gases associated with global warming what options do we have to cope with these facts which of the many proposals are realistic and which are just wishful thinking by the end of this have the necessary conceptual tools to provide your own answers to these questions this mooc is divided into four with the first two understand how scientists measure climate and its evolution how climate models and how greenhouse gases within the atmosphere play a central role in determining the climate the last two introduce the main technologies that can be used to reduce carbon emissions and carbon concentration in the atmosphere and in the light of the facts explained in the first part of the explain how these technologies can be best combined the mooc is for those who want to understand not only the basics of climatechange science but also what we can really and effectively do to curb the present trend in the planets temperatures no previous knowledge is required

the finance of climate change
the urgent transition towards a lowcarbon economy will profoundly change our economy households companies and financial intermediaries have to be ready in order to avoid the downside risks and seize the created by climate change the finance of climate change mooc will explain i how climate change and the policies aimed to mitigate it will impact the different businesses and ii the means and tools at the disposal of companies banks and investors to be part of this transition
what is the shadow price of carbon what makes a bond green how can investors steer the decarbonization of a company how can we make sure that a company is making real efforts to make its business model climateresilient and not just greenwashing these are some of the questions that will be addressed mooc this mooc covers the financial risks and of climate change and how companies can finance their green transition for example by issuing green securities also how financial intermediaries address climate change risks and why central banks are concerned about climate change this mooc is for those who wish to understand the finance of climate it is not necessary to have specialized prior knowledge apart from basic familiarity with accounting and financial concepts such as discounted cash flows we do suggest however taking the first and second mooc of this before starting this one in order to gain a simple but solid understanding of the science and economics aspects of climatic changes

climate aware investing
finance may have a central role to play against climate change on the condition that risks are properly measured and managed be introduced to the latest academic research findings and the most commonly used methods in industry to cope with climate change financial risks
how do we assess these kinds of risks can our portfolios perform and at the same time contribute to the transition towards a lowcarbon economy how do climate change risks affect financial markets this starts with an of climate change and the tools at the disposal of policymakers to curb this phenomenon these tools when used to their fullest extent will have a big impact on businesses and this impact may spill over into the financial markets even before the policies are fully implemented the risks associated with these changes are grouped under the definition of transition risks mooc analyse these risks and also discuss the methodologies most widely used by asset managers to manage their portfolios carbon exposure the final of this shows a realworld example of implementation at the end of the understand how to maximize the contribution of your investments to the fight against climate change

economics and policies of climate change
being aware of the urgency and importance of climate change is not enough to tackle it effectively to avoid the worst climate decisive action has to be taken but what realistic options do we have since our resources are limited is it better to act now or wait until we have more advanced and less expensive technology how big do our abatement efforts have to be
this mooc will help you understand how economists try to answer these questions and find the optimal of action most important it will give you the conceptual tools to draw your own conclusions in the first part of the mooc about the two main approaches used by economists to determine when and how much we should invest in the fight against climate change the first method is the netpresentvalue approach here the social discount rate plays a central role in determining optimal policy by showing how future benefits and costs can be compared and made comparable presentvalued with expenditures today in the second approach how integrated assessment models iams in particular study in detail the strengths and weaknesses of one of the most popular iams the dice model developed by nobel laureate professor nordhaus this model tries to figure out the optimal of action by providing a simplified account of the science the technology and the economics of the problem the second part of this mooc then explores the different types of economic policies that decisionmakers can adopt be introduced to different methods used to control emissions such as carbon taxes regulations and standardsetting also about the most developed emissions trading markets around the world and their effects on the economy this mooc is for those who wish to understand the economics of climate change and use this understanding to form their own informed opinion about the policies on which we can rely to tackle it it is not necessary to have specialized prior knowledge apart from basic familiarity with economic concepts such as utility functions we do suggest however taking the first mooc of this before starting this one in order to gain a simple but solid understanding of the physical and technological aspects of the problems
