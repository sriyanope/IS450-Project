creating sounds for electronic music
what achievein this projectcentered create sounds and use them in your own musical compositions whether youre an aspiring producer composer or hobbyist this will help you gain in music production and confidence using software synthesizers along with your classmates create a massive database of designed sounds or patches to use in your compositions as part of the with a free version of fxpansion strobe what need to get started this is designed for learners who are familiar with music production basics and who have access to some basic music production equipment specifically you should have with a digital audio workstation that supports vst aax or au plugins introduction to music production or pro tools basics are recommended if you do not have this also need a midi keyboard or controller such as an oxygen a digital audio workstation such as pro tools and fxpansion strobe a free day demo will be provided for coursera learners about projectcentered courses this is a projectcentered which means it is designed specifically to help you complete a personally meaningful realworld with your instructor and a community of learners with similar goals providing guidance and suggestions along the way by actively applying new concepts as you master the content more efficiently also get a head start on using the you gain to make positive changes in your life and when you complete the have a finished that be proud to use and share

welcome to creating sounds for electronic music
welcome to your berklee before you begin the we will cover all the details about the and what need to know to get the most out of your berklee
welcome overview what is unique about electronic music prep resource oscillators prep resource filters prep resource lfo prep resource amplifiers

creating a mock up
well start working in strobe and create a mock up of our song we will focus on creating drum and bass patches to use in our songs well also go over the form we will be using for our electronic etudes
initializing strobe dr kick drum ba bass creating your mock up giving and receiving feedback

creating draft
well look at organ lead keys and arpeggiator patches well start researching and adding these patches to our etudes
categories of synthesizer sounds or organs ld leads kb keyboards ar arpeggiator draft

creating draft
well about pads synths unison and chord patches well research these patches and add them to our second draft well also take a look at changing something drastic in our etudes
from preset to perfect pd pad sy synchronized synths un unison ch chord draft

creating draft
well create our third draft well add special fx and texture to our etudes well also expand on the measure form and begin to develop our musical ideas further
timbre as motive force sq sequence fx special fx tx texture draft where to go from here

the technology of music production
about the music production processincluding recording editing and mixingand the tools available to you to create contemporary music on your computerwith the recent introduction of highqualitylowcost software and hardware the tools of music production are now available to the masses albums are made in bedrooms as well as studios on the surface this is liberating anyone can make an album for the low cost of a couple pieces of gear and a software package but if you dig deeper find that it is not so easy producing music requires knowledge dedication and creativity knowledge is where this comes in no matter what kind of music you are making there is a large set of tools that need to use each lesson of this will demonstrate a different set of music production tools loosely following along the music production process of recording editing and mixing we will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it we will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process once recorded sound must be organized along a timeline a process known as editing it allows us to give the impression of perfect performances and create many of the sounds we hear in contemporary music the contemporary editing tool is the digital audio workstation daw a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical we will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all daws provide after editing sounds must be combined or mixed together so we look to the mixing boarda very creative place if you know how to use it we will explore the basic functionality of both hardware and software mixing boards including volume pan mute solo busses inserts sends and submixes the mixing process however includes more tools than the mixing board provides on its own sound must also be processed modified from its recorded state to fit the context of the music we will look at compression equalization and delay and examine the many audio effects that are offshoots of these devices and how they are used in a musical context in the end the music production process relies on your creativity creativity is a product of the mind and will stay there unexpressed until the right tools are used in the right way to share it with the world if you have an idea in your head it will take numerous steps each with an important tool to reach your audience you bring the dedication and creativity and this will bring you the knowledge to make that happen

welcome to the technology of music production
welcome to the here we will cover all the details about the and what need to know to get the most out of your

sound and signal flow
we will start with some background on the nature of sound and how we perceive it we will then examine the components necessary to record audio into a computer so that you understand the devices that sound must travel through in a music production process
lesson overview propagation amplitude frequency visualizing sound connections overview microphone as a transducer microphone types microphone frequency response microphone polar patterns microphone placement line level and gain staging cables interface microphone connection and gain analog to digital converter pickup connections the digital audio workstation daw

the daw
the contemporary editing tool is the digital audio workstation daw a piece of software that stores and organizes all the assets of a musical we will focus on the editing tools that are essential in contemporary music production and that all daws provide
