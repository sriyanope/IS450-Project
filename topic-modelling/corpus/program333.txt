software architecture for big data
this is for software engineers interested in the principles of building and architecting large software systems that use big data through three courses about how to build and architect performant distributed systems from industry experts at initial capacity
this can be taken for academic credit as part of cu boulders ms in data science or ms in computer science degrees offered on the coursera platform these fully accredited graduate degrees offer targeted courses short sessions and payasyougo tuition admission is based on performance in three preliminary courses not academic history cu degrees on coursera are ideal for recent graduates or working professionals more
ms in data science httpswwwcourseraorgdegreesmasterofsciencedatascienceboulder
ms in computer science httpscourseraorgdegreesmscomputerscienceboulder

the first will introduce you to software architecture and design concepts necessary to build and scale large data intensive distributed systems starting with software engineering best practices and loosely coupled highly cohesive data microservices the will take you through the evolution of a distributed system over time
in the second then what is needed to take big data to production transforming big data prototypes into high quality tested production software measure the performance characteristics of distributed systems identify trouble areas and implement scalable solutions to improve performance
the concludes with a projects in which use learnings from the first and second courses to build a productionready distributed system as you progress your instructors will guide you around common pitfalls and share their in building big data systems

applications of software architecture for big data
the is intended for individuals who want to build a productionquality software system that leverages big data
apply the basics of software engineering and architecture to create a productionready distributed system that handles big data build data intensive distributed system composed of loosely coupled highly cohesive applications this can be taken for academic credit as part of cu boulders ms in data science or ms in computer science degrees offered on the coursera platform these fully accredited graduate degrees offer targeted courses short sessions and payasyougo tuition admission is based on performance in three preliminary courses not academic history cu degrees on coursera are ideal for recent graduates or working professionals more ms in data science httpswwwcourseraorgdegreesmasterofsciencedatascienceboulder ms in computer science httpscourseraorgdegreesmscomputerscienceboulder

project
welcome to applications of software architecture for big data this is a projectbased where apply the knowledge and gained from the entire software architecture for big data first about the expectations for the project as as how to establish the features you need to get started with your own
project introduction example codebase project selection white board architecture

mvp development environment
about the concept of a minimum viable product mvp and how to incrementally add features to the mvp additionally show you how to get going with a development environment and set up appropriate tests
what is an mvp testing continuous integration continuous delivery

affixing features
builds upon your previously created mvp now how to create a database populate the database as as analyze the data in the database the ends with further elaboration on testing
handling data rest api

scaling your mvp wrapping up
add more features to your project including collaborative messaging end by building a simple health check for production monitoring and discuss acceptance testing
