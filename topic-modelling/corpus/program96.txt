data science statistics and machine learning
this continues and develops on the material from the data science foundations using ropens in a new tab it covers statistical inference regression models machine learning and the development of data products in the capstone project apply the learned by building a data product using realworld data at completion learners will have a portfolio demonstrating their mastery of the material
the five courses are the very same courses that make up the second half of the data science this is presented for learners who have already mastered the fundamentals and want to skip right to the more advanced courses

each data science statistics and machine learning includes a handson peergraded to earn the you must successfully complete the handson peergraded in each including the final capstone project

practical machine learning
one of the most common tasks performed by data scientists and data analysts are prediction and machine learning this will cover the basic components of building and applying prediction functions with an emphasis on practical applications the will provide basic grounding in concepts such as training and tests sets overfitting and error rates the will also introduce a range of model based and algorithmic machine learning methods including regression classification trees naive bayes and random forests the will cover the complete process of building prediction functions including data collection feature creation algorithms and evaluation

prediction errors and cross validation
will cover prediction relative importance of steps errors and cross validation
prediction motivation what is prediction relative importance of steps in and out of sample errors prediction study design types of errors receiver operating characteristic cross validation what data should you use

the caret package
will introduce the caret package tools for creating features and preprocessing
caret package data slicing training options plotting predictors basic preprocessing covariate creation preprocessing with principal components analysis predicting with regression predicting with regression multiple covariates

predicting with trees random forests model based predictions
we introduce a number of machine learning algorithms you can use to complete your project

regression models
linear models as their name implies relates an to a set of predictors of interest using linear assumptions regression models a subset of linear models are the most important statistical analysis tool in a data scientists toolkit this covers regression analysis least squares and inference using regression models special cases of the regression model anova and ancova will be covered as analysis of residuals and variability will be investigated the will cover modern thinking on model selection and novel uses of regression models including scatterplot smoothing

least squares and linear regression
we focus on least squares and linear regression
introduction to regression introduction basic least squares technical details skip if youd like introductory data example notation and background linear least squares linear least squares coding example technical details skip if youd like regression to the mean

data science capstone
the capstone project class will allow students to create a usablepublic data product that can be used to show your to potential employers projects will be drawn from realworld problems and will be conducted with industry government and academic partners

understanding the problem and getting the data
we introduce the project so you can get a clear grip on the problem at hand and begin working with the dataset
welcome to the capstone project welcome from swiftkey you are a data scientist now introduction to task understanding the problem introduction to task getting and cleaning the data regular expressions part optional regular expressions part optional

exploratory data analysis and modeling
we move on to the next tasks exploratory data analysis and modeling also submit your milestone report and review submissions from your classmates
introduction to task exploratory data analysis introduction to task modeling

prediction model
build and evaluate your prediction model the goal is to make your model efficient and accurate

creative exploration
this weeks goal is to improve the predictive accuracy while reducing computational runtime and model complexity

developing data products
a data product is the production output from a statistical analysis data products automate complex analysis tasks or use technology to expand the utility of a data informed model algorithm or inference this covers the basics of creating data products using shiny r packages and interactive graphics the will focus on the statistical fundamentals of creating a data product that can be used to tell a story about data to a mass audience


go over some information and resources to help you get started and succeed in the

shiny googlevis and plotly
now we can turn to the first substantive lessons how to develop basic applications and interactive graphics in shiny compose interactive html graphics with googlevis and prepare data visualizations with plotly
shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny shiny gadgets shiny gadgets shiny gadgets googlevis googlevis plotly plotly plotly plotly plotly plotly plotly plotly

r markdown and leaflet
during this how to create r markdown files and embed r code in an rmd also explore leaflet and use it to create interactive annotated maps
r markdown r markdown r markdown r markdown r markdown r markdown leaflet leaflet leaflet leaflet leaflet leaflet

r packages
dive into the world of creating r packages and practice developing an r markdown presentation that includes a data visualization built using plotly

statistical inference
statistical inference is the process of drawing conclusions about populations or scientific truths from data there are many modes of performing inference including statistical modeling data oriented strategies and explicit use of designs and randomization in analyses furthermore there are broad theories frequentists bayesian likelihood design based and numerous complexities missing data observed and unobserved confounding biases for performing inference a practitioner can often be left in a debilitating maze of techniques philosophies and nuance this presents the fundamentals of inference in a practical approach for getting things done after taking this students will understand the broad directions of statistical inference and use this information for making informed choices in analyzing data

probability expected values
focus on the fundamentals including probability random variables expectations and more
introductory introduction to probability probability mass functions probability density functions conditional probability bayes rule independence expected values expected values simple examples expected values for pdfs
