hypothesis testing
this will focus on teaching the appropriate test to use when dealing with data and relationships between them it will explain the assumptions of each test and the appropriate language when interpreting the results of a hypothesis test
ztest or ttest dealing with tails and rejections equal vs unequal variances anova correlation tests

regression analysis
this will dive straight into using python to run regression analysis for testing relationships and differences in sample and population means rather than the classical hypothesis testing and how to interpret them
regression the workhorse of statistical analysis regression in place of t test regression in place of anova regression in place of correlation
