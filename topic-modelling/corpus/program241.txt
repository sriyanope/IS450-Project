linux and private cloud administration on ibm power systems
this introduces red hat enterprise linux system administration and private cloud capabilities of ibm systems ibm power servers will be used to demonstrate these concepts through three courses a range of concepts from how to get started with linux to using linux in a large private cloud environment with openstackbased products such as ibm powervc brought to you by ibm

these courses include detailed handson exercises stepbystep guides which teach a range of concepts from how to get started with linux to using linux in a large private cloud environment after completing this you should be able to perform most linux system administration tasks with ease
