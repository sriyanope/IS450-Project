healthy and sustainable foods and products
the effects of climate change have prompted individuals and institutions to evaluate their impact on our planet how you and global companies can reduce the harmful effects of overproduction and overconsumption on our health and the environment using quantitative metrics and assessment methods
this series will allow you to
analyze the health impacts of global trade and identify the steps needed to reach sustainable consumption
assess the nutritional and sustainable performances of individual foods analyzing the tradeoffs between environmental affordable and healthy foods and diets
calculate the environmental impact of systems and products over the entire product life cycle from the cradle to the grave by using the life cycle assessment lca methodology
evaluate and mitigate the exposure impacts and risks of chemicals in a range of products including personal care cleaning building products and toys

through a series of activities and projects address realworld problems and questions including
what are the key risk factors affecting my health in my specific region of the world
how can a single hot dog lead to minutes of healthy life lost
what is best to dry your hands paper towels or electric air dryer
