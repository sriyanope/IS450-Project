being able to group genes by similar patterns of expression across expression data sets using algorithms like wgcna is a very useful way of organizing the data clusters of genes with similar patterns of expression can then be subject to gene ontology term enrichment analysis see or examined to see if they are part of the same pathway whats even more powerful is being able to identify genes with similar patterns of expression without doing a single expression profiling experiment by mining gene expression databases there are several tools that allow you to do this in many plant species simply by entering a query gene identifier the genes that are returned are often in the same biological process as the query gene and thus this guiltbyassociation paradigm is a excellent tool for hypothesis generation

<DOC>promoter analysis
the regulation of gene expression is one of the main ways by which a plant can control the abundance of a gene product posttranslational modifications and protein degradation are some others when and where a gene is expressed is controlled to a large extent by the presence of short sequence motifs called ciselements present in the promoter of the gene these in turn are regulated by transcription factors that perhaps get induced in response to environmental stresses or during specific developmental programs thus understanding which transcription factors can bind to which promoters can help us understand the role the downstream genes might be playing in a biological system

<DOC>network exploration ppis pdis grns
molecules inside the cell rarely operate in isolation proteins act together to form complexes or are part of signal transduction cascades transcription factors bind to ciselements in promoters or elsewhere and can act as activators or repressors of transcription micrornas can affect transcription in other ways one of the main themes to have emerged in the past two decades in biology is that of networks in terms of proteinprotein interaction networks often proteins that are highly connected with others are crucial for biological function when these hubs are perturbed we see large phenotypic effects the way that transcription factors interact with downstream promoters some driving the expression of other transcription factors that in turn regulate genes combinatorially with upstream transcription factors can have an important biological effect in terms of modulating the kind of output achieved the tools described lab can help us to explore molecular interactions in a network context perhaps with the eventual goal of modeling the behaviour of a given system
