the foundational programming topic of data encoding formats is an essential for understanding the more advanced concepts like apis application programming interfaces and python programmability first about the two main data encoding formats xml extensible markup language and json javascript object notation which are commonly used in apis this also introduces yaml a structured data format and markup language commonly used for configuration files in automation and is gaining popularity due to its ease of readability for humans
introduction for reviewing data formats and data encoding data encoding formats javascript object notation extensible markup language yaml data serialization standard ask the expertdata encoding formats

introducing http network apis
the application programming interface api enables unrelated applications to interface with each other without having to understand how each other works or share the same programmatic language apis are becoming more commonplace in todays digital age and are enabling a world of automation and interactivity network engineers need to understand how to leverage apis as vendors like cisco are designing apis for many of their products enabling the ease of network automation and creating more possibilities to interact with rd party nonnetworking products
introduction to introducing http network apis api overview httpbased apis restful apis vs nonrestful apis common api constraints postman streaming telemetry

using python requests to automate httpbased apis
nearly any platform or commercial product comes with some sort of application programming interface api capability many of which are http apis these apis can be used for machinetomachine communication for network automation and can be the catalyst that you need to fully accelerate your network automation journey you have seen how you can use postman for testing and exploring http apis but to do anything with the api while in a programming language like python you need to use an http client one such client which is presented section is the requests for python

templating configurations with jinja
typically network engineers perform countless manual network operations and changes the most common workflow is to build a microsoft notepad file or microsoft word document and call it a template however that template is only a set of instructions for building a configurationit is not a real template jinja is a templating engine that is purposebuilt for python about the jinja templating engine and start to build programmatic templates and command data with real configuration templates
