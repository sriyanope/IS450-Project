optical instruments are how we see the world from corrective eyewear to medical endoscopes to cell phone cameras to orbiting telescopes this will teach you how to design such optical systems with simple graphical techniques then transform those pencil and paper designs to include real optical components including lenses diffraction gratings and prisms how to enter these designs into an industrystandard design tool opticstudio by zemax to analyze and improve performance with powerful automatic optimization methods

this can also be taken for academic credit as ecea part of cu boulders master of science in electrical engineering degree
optical instruments are how we see the world from corrective eyewear to medical endoscopes to cell phone cameras to orbiting telescopes this extends what you have learned about firstorder paraxial system design and optical resolution and efficiency with the introduction to real lenses and their imperfections we begin with a of how different wavelengths propagate through systems then move on to aberrations that appear with high angle nonparaxial systems and how to correct for those problems the wraps up with a discussion of optical components beyond lenses and an excellent example of a highperformance optical system the human eye the mathematical tools required for analysis of highperformance systems are complicated enough that this will rely more heavily on opticstudio by zemax this will allow students to analyze systems that are too complicated for the simple analysis thus far introduced set of courses
