firm level economics consumer and producer behavior
all goods and services are subject to scarcity at some level which requires that society develop some allocation mechanism to determine who gets what over recorded history these allocation rules were usually command based meaning that the king or the emperor would decide in contemporary times most countries have turned to marketbased allocation systems in markets prices act as rationing devices encouraging or discouraging production and encouraging or discouraging consumption to find an equilibrium allocation of resources to understand this process businesses construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and consider supply curves to capture producer behavior the resulting equilibrium price rations the scarce commodityyou will be able to describe consumer behavior as captured by the demand curve and producer behavior as captured by the supply curve define equilibrium and explain the impact of taxes and price controls on market equilibrium explain elasticity of demand describe cost theory and how firms optimize given the constraints of their own costs and an exogenously given price this is part of gies college of business suite of online programs including the imba and imsm more about admission into these programs and explore how your coursera can be leveraged if accepted into a degree at httpsdegreesgiesbusinessillinoiseduidegrees

scarcity allocation and markets
the fundamental problem of scarcity challenges us to think about an allocation mechanism to determine what is produced and who consumes it we will discuss scarcity and allocation mechanisms we will focus on markets and prices as the solution to this resource allocation problem
scarcity and its implications costs demand curves more on the demand curve movements along vs shifts in the demand curve constructing the supply curve movements to new equilibrium

government intervention in markets
markets are frequent targets of governments this will introduce government policy intervention into the market this intervention can be direct control of prices or it could be indirect price pressure through the imposition of taxes or subsidies both forms of intervention are impacted by elasticity
setting dairy prices government intervention direct price controls price floors direct price controls price ceilings the price you pay at the pump excise taxes the incidence of taxation higher tuition yet more college applications responsiveness of quantity demanded and elasticity elasticity along a linear demand

firms production and costs
this will introduce cost theory firms are interested in producing profits which are the residuals when costs are subtracted from revenue earlier constructed demand curves they give us an idea of how many units of product we can sell at different prices this would be firm revenue we will to understand inputs production and costs

firm behavior
the firm goal of profit maximization requires an understanding of costs and revenues we will see how a firm optimally responds to a given market price by finding the profit maximizing output the level of profits at this maximum profit point will help determine short run equilibrium

you have sample data and have done the analysis you think you can say something about the population based on your sample study but do you have a sense of what are the chances of you being right or wrong how can you be surer what else should you have considered how to find the answers to these questions

firm level economics markets and allocations
in markets prices act as rationing devices encouraging or discouraging production and consumption to find an equilibrium to construct demand curves to capture consumer behavior and supply curves to capture producer behavior the resulting equilibrium price rations the scarce commodity additionally the examines the ways in which markets are subject government intervention and the impacts of these interventionsyou will be able to explain how different market structures result in different resource allocations model the impact of external shocks to a particular market structure and demonstrate the new equilibrium price and quantity after the impact of this external shock has played out evaluate the efficiency of an equilibrium explain when and why the government might intervene with regulatory authority or antitrust litigation to lessen inefficiencies in some markets describe how information problems can cause inefficient understand externalities and consider optimal government response to these market failures this is part of gies college of business suite of online programs including the imba and imsm more about admission into these programs and explore how your coursera can be leveraged if accepted into a degree at httpsdegreesgiesbusinessillinoiseduidegrees

monopoly markets and efficiency
analysts can predict equilibrium with some degree of certainty we want to construct a measure of efficiency that will allow us to evaluate the attractiveness of these equilibrium market after using this metric to consider the efficiency of the competitive market we will introduce a different market structure monopoly and use our efficiency metric to evaluate the equilibrium resource allocation under monopoly

oligopoly and game theory
perfectly competitive markets have many sellers monopoly has one seller but much economic activity takes place in markets with just a handful of very large producers these are called oligopoly markets we will look at collusive arrangements among a small number of rivals and then will use simple game theoretic techniques to model equilibrium

market failures
sometimes even markets that appear to be capable of great efficiency in resource allocation such as the perfectly competitive market can fall short of efficiency economists call this market failure we will consider information issues and the impact on efficiency we will also introduce externalities spillovers such as pollution and model these impacts
