data structures and performance
how do java programs deal with vast quantities of data many of the data structures and algorithms that with introductory toy examples break when applications process real large data sets efficiency is critical but how do we achieve it and how do we even measure itthis is an intermediate java we recommend this to learners who have previous in software development or a background in computer science and in particular we recommend that you have taken the first which also requires some previous with java use and analyze data structures that are used in industrylevel applications such as linked lists trees and hashtables explain how these data structures make programs more efficient and flexible apply asymptotic bigo analysis to describe the performance of algorithms and evaluate which strategy to use for efficient data retrieval addition of new data deletion of elements andor memory usage the build throughout this allows its user to manage manipulate and reason about large sets of textual data this is an intermediate java and we will build on your prior knowledge this is designed around the same series as in our first including explanations of core content learner student and engineer testimonials and support to better allow you to choose your own path through the

introduction to the
welcome to the first in the second of our intermediate java programming well start with introductions again to ourselves the google engineers and the structure of the after the introduction well have a short warm up to get you comfortable with the code be building on to this class but dont worryno graded programming yet is all about getting comfortable and excited to
title welcome object oriented java programming data structures and beyond welcome object oriented programming in java your path through the concept challenges in the real world welcome from google engineers prototype

working with strings
were going to dive into the programming in the first lesson about strings and regular expressions and in the programming apply that knowledge to adding functionality to your text editor so that it can measure the readability of text by calculating something called the flesch readability score this is focused on building code that not only does interesting things but also finishes them quickly so lets get started building some code

efficiency analysis and benchmarking
welcome to the texteditor application you worked with last does something but it doesnt do it particularly fast well start talking about efficiency well introduce the concept of bigo notation which sounds a little silly but is really a powerful and extremely common way of analyzing a programs efficiency independent of the system that its running on and the exact details of how its implemented then well go the other direction and dive into the details talking about how to measure the actual running time of a piece of code to get an idea of how it really performs in practice

interfaces linked lists vs arrays and correctness
well start talking about some of the basic concepts that one expects to find in a data structures the idea of data abstraction and a data structure called a linked list even though linked lists are not very efficient structures for the most part they do hit home the idea of linking pieces of data together in your computers memory rather than storing the data in one contiguous region this linking idea will be central to many of the more advanced data structures namely trees and graphs that are coming up later and in the next also tools and procedures for unit testing your code which is a way to make sure that what youve written is correct and a staple practice of any sophisticated software developer

trees including binary search trees and tries
welcome to we know youve been working hard we hope you tried that optional markov text generation programming last but if not no worries you can always go back and do it later spoiler alert its pretty amazing that such a simple algorithm can produce such realistic text theres more fun and hard as we about trees trees rely on the same linked structure idea as linked lists only theyre much faster usually in the add autocomplete to your text editor believe us when we say its so cool when you get it working see and we bet you cant wait for the programming now

hash maps and edit distance
you made it to the last congratulations on getting this far last well be looking at a fundamental data structure called a hash table if you thought trees were fast just wait until you see what hash tables can do your last programming will add spelling correction suggestions to your text editor and theres an optional that builds on the same ideas as the main too if you have the time and energy
