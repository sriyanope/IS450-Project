user interaction design for arvrmrxr
this second in the xr for everybody looks at how to design new user for xr technologies the provides learners with a design thinking mindset and equips them with a fundamental toolbox for creating xr applications using rapid prototyping it starts with a broad overview of the complete xr design process discussing different paths to becoming an xr creator what is generally involved in making xr and how to best get started the then emphasizes design thinking critiques and ethics while introducing guidelines and usercentered techniques like design jams the second half of the introduces a variety of methods and tools for prototyping both physically and digitally including on the xr devices themselves through immersive authoringthe has an honors track that guides learners through creating their own storyboard physical prototype and digital prototype of an xr on exercises that allow you to practice your design and also build xr technologies into your workflow by working with specific templates and new digital tools that allow you to preview physical prototypes on arvr devices

xr design process
this will provide you with an introduction to xr design and development when i say design i usually mean user design or interaction design some designers have quite specific definitions of each of those terms but i think of them broadly as forms of design focused on the creation of new user interfaces while i think of many parts of this as providing the theory and background to xr design i will focus on the practical aspects of xr creation i will start by making an analogy to filmmaking to establish key requirements before going on to talk about the main steps part of a larger process and how to get started with doing xr as we are just getting started this first does not have an honors track component associated with it the honors track will start in the second
meet your instructor overview what doing xr involves part what doing xr involves part developing xr how to get started for everybody part how to get started for everybody part finding your xr process xr design primer

design thinking ethics and guidelines for xr
the second will introduce you to design thinking and how common methods and techniques can be adapted for xr this will help us build the right mindset for designing novel and compelling xr we will talk about building empathy with your users ethical and responsible design and best practices and design guidelines i will also cover how to conduct and formulate design critiques in an effort to from existing interfaces finally we will look at design jams as a way of solving design challenges collaboratively our first exercise in the honors track associated with this will be a design critique of a vr or ar expedition as part of googles expeditions xr app be asked to develop one new idea that then take forward as you start prototyping your design concept next

storyboarding physical prototyping for xr
we are moving from the conceptual to the practical from thinking to doing the next two parts of this are dedicated to prototyping first part on physical prototyping i will emphasize paper a lot and also talk a lot about sketching in my mind brainstorming translates to sketching alternate ideas rather than creating for example a mind map i sketch to ideate this is a practice that i will emphasize well start flat on paper but will quickly become more physical using specific paper templates and dioramas well also see how to create mostly physical prototypes but how to enhance them with ar techniques to move closer to our envisioned final xr in the honors track have two major exercises first create an xr storyboard based on the xr app you have previously critiqued the design critique and storyboarding will help you develop a new idea of improving the existing xr interface then prototype your design concept using physical materials including paper cardboard playdoh and transparency i hope appreciate the freedom and flexibility that physical prototyping gives you allowing you to create a new xr without many of the constraints of digital tools

digital prototyping evaluation of xr
the last of this will cover digital prototyping and user evaluation techniques for xr while it is recommended to start prototyping on paper it is crucial to a design concept for xr with xr technologies i will introduce you to digital prototyping techniques as a way of increasing the fidelity of your prototype designs about digital prototyping tools that support creating initial vr or ar without the need for programming some tools support immersive authoring which enables prototyping of xr directly inside vr or ar we will also about usability evaluation techniques and how to design and conduct a user study our final lecture will be on creating your xr portfolio as a way of effectively communicating and showcasing your design in the honors track we will finalize our xr with a digital prototype and submit our for peer review the peer review will not only provide important feedback on your but also allow you to review and critique your peers in a constructive way i consider formulating good feedback and acting on critical feedback two vital for any designer but especially for those working in a space as rapidly evolving as xr

developing arvrmrxr apps with webxr unity unreal
this third in the xr for everybody is geared toward the technical development of xr the provides learners with a more technical mental model of xr technologies and the tools to approach xr development with confidence it walks through the stages of development for both vr and ar introducing the main xr development platforms as well as the key methods and tools this third also helps learners infer advanced xr requirements from physicaldigital prototypes and teaches them how to differentiate major technical concerns estimate development costs and plan research necessary to advance xrthis also has an honors track that guides learners in the implementation of d vr and ar scenes in webxr using aframe and in unity and helps them generate a development plan with clear milestones and deliverables

xr development approaches
this first will cover three main approaches to xr development webxr unity and unreal each approach requires different development tools programming languages and technical they also differ in the fidelity and quality that can be achieved and in how many devices and users can be reached with each in addition to getting a fundamental overview of xr development platforms and tools a main goal is to make the jump from d to d many of our learners will be familiar with web and mobile development but d development is quite different in the honors track i will guide you through the creation of your first d scene using webxr unity or unreal i will also provide first steps instructions in each of them allowing you to analyze and compare before choosing your approach and tools

developing vr applications
this second will focus on the development of vr applications we will what it takes to create a virtual reality about menus and navigation techniques in vr as well as object selection and manipulation ill share various examples that i have implemented using webxr to illustrate the concepts i will also cover approaches in unity and unreal also see me give demos directly in vr to better understand how navigation and interactions in vr many of the lessons are rooted in a vr design case study inspired by the detroit zoo which my student kara dailey and i created specifically for this xr mooc in the honors track i will guide you through the creation of your first vr scene using aframe unity or unreal and i will provide more handson lectures on how to create basic and immersive vr scenes with webxr using aframe

intro to arvrmrxr technologies applications issues
this first in the xr for everybody creates a foundational understanding of the differences between ar vr mr and xr the provides learners with a broad overview of the rapidly evolving xr space and the tools to characterize future xr developments and assess their potential and limitations it establishes key concepts and dives into the xr device landscape helping learners to differentiate current and future platforms and devices as well as critique the use of vr or ar in applications the pivots in the second half to look more at how to shape the future of xr by analyzing trends and raising issues such as covid social and ethical concerns accessibility and equity as well as privacy and securitythe comes with an honors track in which learners will try out and classify existing xr applications pick technologies when designing solutions for various xr application scenarios and dive into the issues contributing to the larger discussion around trends and the future of xr

xr terminology applications
this will establish the different notions around xr and provide a brief overview of the associated technologies key to understanding the potential and limitations of ar vr and mr is to know the differences in how they each and what they each can be used for in the honors track how to find and try out an ar and classify it along the realityvirtuality continuum this continuum is an important notion to localize applications in the wide spectrum covered by mixed reality technologies and aids our overall understanding of the xr space
meet your instructor overview what is xr v what is xr v xr technology landscape welcome to the honors track your xr app classification

xr concepts technologies
this will provide an overview of virtual and augmented reality both at the conceptual level as well as in terms of current technologies it is important to distinguish concepts from technologies because the concepts are foundational and less likely to change significantly while the technologies that implement the concepts are rapidly evolving in the honors track we will use the conceptual and technological insights we developed through the standard track to recommend ar or vr technologies for a set of given scenarios a key goal for us is to obtain a thorough overview of the technology landscape and this activity will allow you to practice your decision making and how to analyze and assess different technology options

trends issues in xr
this will start our discussion of the and challenges that come with xr technologies i will identify technological trends and what i think are some of the key issues the issues will be grouped into three broader classes ethical social concerns accessibility equity privacy security all three classes are important and we currently only have a limited understanding and clear ways forward regarding each of them in the honors track we will through some of these issues and depending on your interests and access to xr technologies you can set your focus on one of the classes of issues there will be activities to more about social in arvr accessibility and privacy i look forward to an open and constructive discussion with you about these issues and the future of xr technologies

xr strategy
this is our last it will bring more of a strategic outlook into the xr space this is a space where you have to continuously and push yourself i believe you have to develop a growth mindset when you think about new and initiatives your team the equipment working with stakeholders and defining measures of success the key is to start somewhere with something small then grow your and expectations around it most people try it the other way around not realizing that xr is a huge space and there will always be people who know more than you about something in my opinion the best way to go about this is to find a niche realize the potential to innovate and start shaping your solution this is heavily discussionbased and there is no honors track associated with it thank you for taking this first and please check out the other two courses series
