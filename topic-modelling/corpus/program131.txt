everyday excel
this is for learners wishing to microsoft excel from beginner level to expert level the first two courses will teach learners the basics of excel through the use of dozens of educational screencasts and a series of quizzes and inapplication finally in part projects learners will complete several real world somewhat open ended yet guided projects in the projects special emphasis is placed on dynamic array functions which are new in office and have revolutionized the way that worksheet calculations are performed

in part projects learners choose three warmup projects chosen from five potential projects three intermediate projects chosen from six potential projects and three main projects chosen from five potential projects thus learners have liberty to tailor their through choice of projects screencasts are provided that show hints and previews for each project
