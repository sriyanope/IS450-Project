applied projectthere is a peerreviewed final at the end of each learners will apply the they gained from the such as analyzing a living organism in an ecosystem near them or coming up with biological features of an imaginary species to complete these final and provide feedback to each other through the review process

introduction to biology ecology
ecology is all about connections well see how interdependent every living thing is and how people are impacting the natural world like all sciences ecology isnt just a list of known facts its also a process i love telling stories and ive included many stories about how weve come to know what we know about ecology through observations and experiments

welcome to introduction to biology ecology
discussion prompt
welcome to ecology meet your professor

what is ecology
we will about the goals of the science of ecology and some of the ways in which ecology can be applied to help people
humboldts climb the science of ecology

community ecology
we will about the factors that influence the distribution of life on earth some of the approaches that ecologists use to study ecological communities and how the concept of an ecological niche can be used to understand the of competition between species
linnaeus quest abiotic factors geographic distribution modeling barnacles the ecological niche concept what happens when niches overlap ecological

island biogeography
we will about the development of the equilibrium theory of island biogeography and how it can be applied both to real islands and to protected areas
island biogeography classic experiment mangrove islands applying island biogeography to all types of islands

species interactions
we will about the various ways that species interact with one another the role of keystone species in natural ecosystems and how disturbances like floods and fires affect ecological communities
classic experiment sea stars the wolves of yellowstone how prey avoid predators when species cooperate ants and acacias why species sometimes cooperatepart ii commensalism

population ecology
we will how ecologists estimate population sizes of wild animals the factors that affect population size in animals and people and the history and recent trends in human population growth
conducting a population census changes in population size factors that limit population growth human population growth

conservation biology
we will about the major threats to living species and the impacts of habitat loss invasive species and climate change on the natural world
how humans impact the natural world habitat loss classic experiment amazon forest fragmentation invasive species climate change and the carbon cycle how climate change affects nature

the future of the biosphere
we will about the current declines in biodiversity and how biodiversity loss affects ecosystems and people
the sixth mass extinction what happens to ecosystems when species disappear pollination and our food supply how biodiversity loss affects people wetlands how biodiversity loss affects people disease biophilia and cultural considerations for biodiversity loss

introduction to biology evolution
evolution is one of the most interesting fields within biology and one thats central to a complete understanding of modern biology we begin by tracing how charles darwin developed a theory of evolution by natural selection and the many ways that biologists have advanced the science of evolution since his lifetime we then go on to about the many applications of evolutionary biology to our everyday lives

welcome to evolution
discussion prompt
introduction meet your professor

on the origins of evolution
we will how ideas about evolution changed from ancient greece to victorian england when two naturalists independently developed a theory of evolution by natural selection
why evolution matters early ideas of evolution charles darwin part i charles darwin part ii alfred russel wallace on the origin of species

how evolution works
we will what darwin proposed about evolution by natural selection how the other mechanisms of evolution and how the hardyweinberg principle can be used to determine whether a population is evolving
what did darwin propose what was missing from darwins theory why darwin was disgusted by peacocks mechanisms of evolution classic experiment lederbergs experiment hardyweinberg equilibrium

macroevolution
we will about the process of speciation how evolutionary relationships can be depicted using phylogenetic trees and some of the practical applications of phylogenetics
speciation part i speciation part ii phylogenetics applying phylogenetics

evidence for evolution
we will about the many different types of evidence for evolution including the fossil record biogeography comparative anatomy and direct observation and gain an appreciation for the role of evolution in the development of antibioticresistant bacteria
transitional forms evidence for evolution biogeography comparative anatomy galapagos finches lenskis experiment interview with dr shamoo

introduction to biology biodiversity
we will examine the incredible variety of life that inhabits this planet including microorganisms plants and animals for each of the major groups well about their characteristics functions and how they came into existence as well as some of the roles they play in the natural world and how theyre relevant to people well also take a close look at us humans and consider what we know about our origins and what might become of us in the future

welcome to introduction of biology biodiversity
discussion prompt
welcome to biodiversity meet your professor

what is life and how did it begin
discussion prompt
how many species are currently alive on earth what is a species origin of life classic experiment simulating the origin of life how did life begin

prokaryotic life
we will about the major groups of prokaryotes the role of the human microbiome the discovery of antibiotics and how bacteria develop antibiotic resistance
bacteria archaea the microbiome antibiotics

eukaryotic life
we will about the differences between prokaryotes and eukaryotes the major groups of protists plants and fungi and how they affect people and other organisms
the eukaryotic cell protists how plants help people key innovations of plants fungi

invertebrate animals
we will about the evolutionary origins of animals as well as some of the characteristics and importance of invertebrate animals such as cnidarians rotifers mollusks and arthropods
animals the cambrian explosion cnidarians rotifers molluscs arthropods the permian extinction

vertebrate animals
we will about the major groups of fish reptiles amphibians and birds
fish the adaptable fish body plan amphibians reptiles dinosaurs birds the cretaceous extinction

mammals and humans
we will about the major groups of mammals including humans and other primates
mammals the placenta pleistocene megafauna primates human evolution the fossil record human evolution genetic evidence our evolutionary future
