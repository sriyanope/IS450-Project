programming in c a handson introduction
this is intended for people without programming who seek to develop c programming and about the underlying computer science concepts that will allow them to pick up other programming languages quickly in these four courses cover everything from fundamentals to objectoriented design these topics will help prepare you to write anything from small programs to automate repetitive tasks to larger applications giving you enough understanding of c to tackle more specialized topics such as data science and artificial intelligenceapplied projectlearners will create a variety of practical including helpful c programs that can speed up everyday tasks such as an automated file updater later will create graphical output using the clmg library and even including animations

c object basics functions recursion and objects
code and run your first c in minutes without installing anythingthis is designed for learners with limited coding providing a solid foundation of not just c but core computer science topics that can be transferred to other languages the cover functions recursion objects and mutability completion of the prior courses are recommended to allow for a truly handson selfpaced this is videofree contain short explanations with images and runnable code examples with suggested edits to explore code examples further building a deeper understanding by doing benefit from instant feedback from a variety of assessment items along the way gently progressing from quick understanding checks multiple choice fill in the blank and unscrambling code blocks to small approachable coding exercises that take minutes instead of hours
