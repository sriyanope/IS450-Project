getting started with google kubernetes engine
welcome to the getting started with google kubernetes engine if youre interested in kubernetes a software layer that sits between your applications and your hardware infrastructure then youre in the right place google kubernetes engine brings you kubernetes as a managed service on google cloud the goal of this is to introduce the basics of google kubernetes engine or gke as its commonly referred to and how to get applications containerized and running in google cloud the starts with a basic introduction to google cloud and is then followed by an overview of containers and kubernetes kubernetes architecture and kubernetes operations

introduction
the introduction explains the goals and previews each section

introduction to google cloud
the first section of this introduces cloud computing concepts learners explore fundamental terminology the google cloud network how google cloud resources are organized in an hierarchy for management and the tools available to connect to google cloud for allocating changing and releasing resources
introduction cloud computing and google cloud google cloud compute offerings the google network resource management billing interacting with google cloud lab introduction accessing the cloud console and cloud shell coursera getting started with google cloud platform and qwiklabs

introduction to containers and kubernetes
the second section of this examines software containers and the benefit they bring to application deployment learners explore containers and container images cloud build kubernetes and google kubernetes engine
introduction containers container images lab introduction working with cloud build kubernetes google kubernetes engine

kubernetes architecture
the third section of this explores the components of a kubernetes cluster and how they together learners deploy a kubernetes cluster by using google kubernetes engine deploy pods to a gke cluster and view and manage different kubernetes objects
introduction kubernetes concepts kubernetes components gke autopilot and gke standard object management lab introduction deploying gke autopilot clusters

kubernetes operations
the final section of this introduces the kubectl command which is the command line utility used to interact with and manage the resources inside kubernetes clusters learners are introduced to the concept of introspection then get practice deploying google kubernetes engine clusters from cloud shell
introduction the kubectl command introspection lab introduction deploying gke autopilot clusters from cloud shell

logging and monitoring in google cloud
this teaches participants techniques for monitoring and improving infrastructure and application performance in google cloudusing a combination of presentations demos handson labs and realworld case studies attendees gain with fullstack monitoring realtime log management and analysis debugging code in production tracing application performance bottlenecks and profiling cpu and memory usage

introduction
welcome to logging and monitoring in google cloud we will cover the prerequisites audience and the objectives

introduction to google cloud observability
we will take some time to do a highlevel overview of the various products which comprise google clouds logging monitoring and observability suite
overview need for google cloud observability cloud monitoring cloud logging error reporting application performance management tools

monitoring critical systems
monitoring is all about keeping track of exactly whats happening with the resources weve spun up inside of googles cloud well take a look at options and best practices as they relate to monitoring architectures well differentiate the core cloud iam roles needed to decide who can do what as it relates to monitoring just like architecture this is another crucial early step we will examine some of the google created default dashboards and see how to use them appropriately we will create charts and use them to build custom dashboards to show resource consumption and application load and finally we will define uptime checks to track liveliness and latency
overview monitoring overview cloud monitoring achitecture patterns monitoring multiple data model and dashboards query metrics uptime checks getting started with google cloud platform and qwiklabs

alerting policies
alerting gives timely awareness to problems in your cloud applications so you can resolve the problems quickly how to develop alerting strategies define alerting policies add notification channels identify types of alerts and common uses for each construct and alert on resource groups and manage alerting policies programmatically
overview sli slo and sla developing an alerting strategy creating alerts service monitoring

advanced logging and analysis
we will examine some of google clouds advanced logging and analysis capabilities specifically to identify and choose among resource tagging approaches define log sinks create monitoring metrics based on log entries link application errors to logging and other operation tools using error reporting and export logs to bigquery for long term storage and sql based analysis
overview cloud logging overview and architecture log types and collection storing routing and exporting the logs query and view logs using logbased metrics log analytics

working with audit logs
we will examine how to use cloud audit logs how to use cloud audit logs to answer the question who did what and when we will also cover best practices for audit logging
overview cloud audit logs data access audit logs audit logs entry format best practices


we will summarize the topics covered couse
