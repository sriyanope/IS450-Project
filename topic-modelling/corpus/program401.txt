making meaning clear
this introduces learners to the role of a teacher in helping to motivate and properly engage learners it begins with a metaphor language is cake meaning that language must be presented well in order to be enjoyed we will actually perform a skit to show this meaning clearly this will demonstrate how a teacher can encourage a student and increase motivation by paying attention to techniques such as improving teacher talk scaffolding language and the use of body language to make meaning clear all of these while gained over the of a lifetime as a language teacher must be considered primary goals from the very beginning and all of these help a teacher recognize that presentation make a difference to learners not only in motivating them but in allowing them to understand the concepts presented

acquisition vs two modes of language is basketball practice in the two modes and essential question

taking risks and learner strategies
using languagelearning expert francois gouins of going to germany and failing to german this demonstrates the need for learners to understand how a language is learned gouins demonstrates not only the need for a diffuse mode of wherein practice is valued but it also demonstrates the psyche of many second language learners francois in some sense was too smart for his own good relying on techniques for material that dont apply to language use and application students must use techniques and strategies that are proven to help someone acquire language like those from the good language learner studies teachers can facilitate student by helping to demonstrate good language learner principles
