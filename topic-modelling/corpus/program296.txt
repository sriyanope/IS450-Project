basic magnetics
magnetics are an integral part of every switching converter often the design of the magnetic devices cannot be isolated from the converter design the power electronics engineer must not only model and design the converter but must model and design the magnetics as modeling and design of magnetics for switching converters is the topic of this basic magnetics theory is reviewed including magnetic circuits inductor modeling and transformer modeling this provides the technical tools needed in the remainder of the to understand operation of magnetic devices model their losses and design magnetic devices for switching converters
a brief introduction to the basic relationships lecture magnetic circuits lecture transformer modeling loss mechanisms in magnetic devices

ac copper losses
eddy currents also cause power losses in winding conductors this can lead to copper losses significantly in excess of the value predicted by the dc winding resistance the specific conductor eddy current mechanisms are called the skin effect and the proximity effect these effects are most pronounced in highcurrent conductors of multilayer windings particularly in highfrequency converters this explains these physical mechanisms and provides practical methods to compute these losses
introduction to the skin and proximity effects leakage flux in windings foil windings and layers power loss in a layer example power loss in a transformer winding interleaving the windings pwm waveform harmonics

inductor design
the goal of this chapter is to design inductors for switching converters specifically magnetic elements such as filter inductors are designed using the geometric constant kg method the maximum flux density bmax is specified in advance and the element is designed to attain a given copper loss both singlewinding inductors and multiplewinding elements such as coupled inductors and flyback transformers are considered
several types of magnetic devices their bh loops and core vs copper loss filter inductor design constraints a firstpass design window area allocation coupled inductor design constraints firstpass design procedure coupled inductor example coupled inductor for a twooutput forward converter example ccm flyback transformer

transformer design
in a substantial class of magnetic applications the operating flux density is limited by core loss rather than saturation for example in a conventional highfrequency transformer usually it is necessary to limit the core loss by operating at a reduced value of the peak ac flux density hence design of corelosslimited magnetic devices is characterized by finding the ac flux density that minimizes total core plus copper lossthis considers the design of transformers and ac inductors for switching converters including minimization of total loss design examples include the isolation transformers of a full bridge twooutput converter and of an isolated cuk converter
