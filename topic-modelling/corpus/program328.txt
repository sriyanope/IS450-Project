six sigma black belt
learners developed and furthered their understanding of the six sigma dmaic process this also explored the intersection between six sigma and lean as well as developed enhanced understanding of the dmaic process beyond the confines of green belt instruction by also including content in organizational planning and development team management and design for six sigma applied projectthroughout the learners are tasked with the completion of portions of a capstone type peer reviewed grounded in the dmaic process and implemented such that the deliverables align with the content presented in the quizzes are also offered to reinforce and cement understanding of the content
