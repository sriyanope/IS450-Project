introduction to portfolio construction and analysis with python
the practice of investment management has been transformed in recent years by computational methods this provides an introduction to the underlying science with the aim of giving you a thorough understanding of that scientific basis however instead of merely explaining the science we help you build on that foundation in a practical manner with an emphasis on the handson implementation of those ideas in the python programming language this is the first in a four in data science and machine in asset management but can be taken independently we cover the basics of investment science and well build practical implementations of each of the concepts along the way well start with the very basics of risk and return and quickly progress to cover a range of topics including several nobel prize winning concepts well cover some of the most popular practical techniques in modern state of the art investment management and portfolio construction as we cover the theory and math in lecture well also implement the concepts in python and be able to code along with us so that you have a deep and practical understanding of how those methods by the time you are done not only will you have a foundational understanding of modern computational methods in investment management have practical mastery in the implementation of those methods

python and machine for asset management
this will enable you mastering machinelearning approaches in the area of investment management it has been designed by two thought leaders in their field lionel martellini from edhecrisk institute and john mulvey from princeton university starting from the basics they will help you build practical to understand data science so you can make the best portfolio decisionsthe will start with an introduction to the fundamentals of machine followed by an indepth discussion of the application of these techniques to portfolio management decisions including the design of more robust factor models the construction of portfolios with improved diversification benefits and the implementation of more efficient risk management models we have designed a step process first we will introduce a meaningful investment problem and see how this problem can be addressed using statistical techniques then we will see how this new insight from machine can complete and improve the relevance of the analysis have the to capitalize on and recommended to level up your financial expertise and to use the quizzes and jupiter notebooks to ensure grasp of concept at the end of this master the various machine techniques in investment management

python and machinelearning for asset management with alternative data sets
overutilization of market and accounting data over the last few decades has led to portfolio crowding mediocre performance and systemic risks incentivizing financial institutions which are looking for an edge to quickly adopt alternative data as a substitute to traditional data this introduces the core concepts around alternative data the most recent research area as well as practical portfolio examples and actual applications the approach of this is somewhat unique because while the theory covered is still a main component practical lab sessions and examples of working with alternative datasets are also key this is fo you if you are aiming at carreers prospects as a data scientist in financial markets are looking to enhance your analytics skillsets to the financial markets or if you are interested in cuttingedge technology and research as they apply to big data the required background is python programming investment theory and statistics this will enable you to new data and research techniques applied to the financial markets while strengthening data science and python

consumption
the consumption introduces students to the basics of consumptionbased alternative data by aggregating online and offline consumer purchase activity and behavioral datasets including geolocation data eg cell locations satellite imagery etc transaction data eg credit card transaction logs and point of sale data as well as consumer interaction with brands and products on social media researchers can about company performance ahead of official company earning announcements such information may be extremely useful and can provide investment and risk management advantages this reviews the theoretical aspects of various consumption datasets and provides practical demonstrations of relevant data analytics
welcome what is consumption data geolocation and foottraffic lab session introduction to the uber dataset lab session points of interest lab session mapping data with folium lab session testing seasonality application consumption data and earning surprises applicationconsumptionbased proxies for private information and managers behavior application additional applications of consumption data

textual analysis for financial applications
is an introduction to text mining as well as a demonstration of how to get from data retrieval web scraping to financial market insights some of the classic text mining methodologies are covered such as vectorization of text the bag of words approach stop words for filtering and term frequencyinverse document frequency tfidf students will how text can be mathematically represented and regularizedfiltered to reduce noise measures of textsimilarity will be covered in theoretical and practice sessions lab sessions go through examples of web scraping data regularizing with the described techniques and finally insights will be derived from the textual data
introduction to the open web introduction to textual analysis processing text into vectors normalizing textual data lab session introduction to webscraping lab session applied text data processing lab session company distances and industry distances application applying similarity analysis on corporate filings to predict returns

processing corporate filings
is a practical extension of the text mining lessons to k and f two of the most commonly researched corporate filings this type of data can be extremely daunting when used by individual analysts due to the sheer size of the documents but describes the methodologies for quantitatively analyzing these documents with python code both the k and f documents are worked through and within the lab sessions it is demonstrated how one can automatically pull this kind of data as well as define metrics around them we investigate implementations of research field around similarity of given companies k statements over time as well as similarity between fund holdings from the f in the lab
introduction to corporate filings lab session working with k data lab session applications of tfidf lab session risk analysis lab session working with f data lab session comparing holding similarities application network centrality competition links and stock returns application using location data to measure home bias to predict returns

using mediaderived data
the final introduces both sentiment analysis in the context of textual data as well as network analysis in the context of connectivity of firms sentiment analysis is an avenue of potentially fruitful information that when done correctly can display what a general population might believe about a company through for example social media or even whether the company itself is positive or negative on future outlook through analysis of tone in corporate filings network analysis as shown in the research of instructors and his colleagues can be used to accurately capture how a financial network is oriented and what companies might perform well because of other firms mentioning them as a threat the lab session of this extends the corporate filings analysis to examine sentiment while also introducing a set of tweets which are then transformed into a network representation
