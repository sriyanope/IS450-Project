data analytics in the public sector with r
every government entity collects and stores millions of data points to perform administrative and legislative duties allocate resources and make decisions professionals in the public sector need the necessary to accurately interpret and inform administrators and policymakers about the meaning behind these data
this will equip you with fundamental technical using the r programming language to gather manipulate analyze visualize and interpret data to inform public policy and public administrative functions throughout four courses gain new using the popular tidyverse packages such as dplyr for data manipulation and ggplot for visualization identify and address common political and ethical challenges in data analysis and better understand public administration and public policy concepts using handson activities with realworld data sets
this series is ideal for current or earlycareer professionals in the public sector looking to gain in analyzing public data effectively
there are no prerequisites though programming ideally with the r language and basic applied statistics knowledge are recommended the google data analytics offers such foundational earn a dual badge when you complete the google and this all coursework is completed in rstudio in coursera without the need to install additional software

there is an to practice all of your r within handson exercises for each in the capstone exercise of learners will analyze data as part of policy options analysis create a visualization of the results of the analysis and make a recommendation based on the results
