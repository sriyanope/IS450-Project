natural disaster and climate change risk assessment
this specialized is aimed at officials professionals and team members involved in formulating executing or supervising infrastructure projects who seek to incorporate disaster risk analysis and climate change adaptation into their projects
through courses students will be trained to identify key elements of natural disaster risk recognize the importance of integrating risk analysis into the infrastructure project cycle conduct qualitative and quantitative assessments to make informed decisions discern when to apply each type of risk assessment evaluate the technical and economic feasibility of projects through qualitative and quantitative analysis and finally generate informed recommendations for the design construction operation and governance of infrastructure in a context of risk and climate change
it is recommended to take the courses in the suggested order

throughout the specialized participants will have the to apply their learning in the analysis and study of various aspects of risk in infrastructure through different practical cases
for this purpose they will have access to trial versions of various programs developed by ipresas these programs only on windowsbased computers
