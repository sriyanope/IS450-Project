data science foundations using r
this covers foundational data science tools and techniques including getting cleaning and exploring data programming in r and conducting reproducible research learners who complete this will be prepared to take the data science statistics and machine learningopens in a new tab in which they build a data product using realworld data
the five courses are the very same courses that make up the first half of the data science this is presented for learners who want to start and complete the foundational part of the curriculum first before moving onto the more advanced topics in data science statistics and machine learning

in taking the data science foundations using r learners will complete a project at the ending of each projects include installing tools programming in r cleaning data performing analyses as as peer review

programming with r
welcome to of r programming we take the gloves off and the lectures cover key topics like control structures and functions we also introduce the first programming for the which is due at the end of the
control structures introduction control structures ifelse control structures for loops control structures while loops control structures repeat next break your first r function functions part functions part scoping rules symbol binding scoping rules r scoping rules scoping rules optimization example optional coding standards dates and times

loop functions and debugging
we have now entered the third of r programming which also marks the halfway point the lectures cover loop functions and the debugging tools in r these aspects of r make r useful for both interactive and writing longer code and so they are commonly used in practice
loop functions lapply loop functions apply loop functions mapply loop functions tapply loop functions split debugging tools diagnosing the problem debugging tools basic tools debugging tools using the tools

simulation profiling
covers how to simulate data in r which serves as the basis for doing simulation studies we also cover the profiler in r which lets you collect detailed information on how your r functions are running and to identify bottlenecks that can be addressed the profiler is a key tool in helping you optimize your programs finally we cover the str function which i personally believe is the most useful function in r
the str function simulation generating random numbers simulation simulating a linear model simulation random sampling r profiler part r profiler part

reproducible research
this focuses on the concepts and tools behind reporting modern data analyses in a reproducible manner reproducible research is the idea that data analyses and more generally scientific claims are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them the need for reproducibility is increasing dramatically as data analyses become more complex involving larger datasets and more sophisticated computations reproducibility allows for people to focus on the actual content of a data analysis rather than on superficial details reported in a written in addition reproducibility makes an analysis more useful to others because the data and code that actually conducted the analysis are available this will focus on literate statistical analysis tools which allow one to publish data analyses in a single document that allows others to easily execute the same analysis to obtain the same results

concepts ideas structure
will cover the basic ideas of reproducible research since they may be unfamiliar to some of you we also cover structuring and organizing a data analysis to help make it more reproducible i recommend that you watch the in the order that they are listed on the web page but watching the out of order isnt going to ruin the story
introduction what is reproducible research about reproducible research concepts and ideas part reproducible research concepts and ideas part reproducible research concepts and ideas part scripting your analysis structure of a data analysis part structure of a data analysis part organizing your analysis

markdown knitr
we cover some of the core tools for developing reproducible documents we cover the literate programming tool knitr and show how to integrate it with markdown to publish reproducible web documents we also introduce the first peer assessment which will require you to write up a reproducible data analysis using knitr
coding standards in r markdown r markdown r markdown demonstration knitr part knitr part knitr part knitr part introduction to project

reproducible research checklist evidencebased data analysis
covers what one could call a basic check list for ensuring that a data analysis is reproducible while its not absolutely sufficient to follow the check list it provides a necessary minimum standard that would be applicable to almost any area of analysis

the data scientists toolbox
get an introduction to the main tools and ideas in the data scientists toolbox the gives an of the data questions and tools that data analysts and data scientists with there are two components to this the first is a conceptual introduction to the ideas behind turning data into actionable knowledge the second is a practical introduction to the tools that will be used in the like version control markdown git github r and rstudio

data science fundamentals
introduce and define data science and data itself also go over some of the resources that data scientists use to get help when theyre stuck
why automated what is data science what is data getting help the data science process

r and rstudio
help you get up and running with both r and rstudio along the way some basics about both and why data scientists use them
installing r installing r studio rstudio tour r packages projects in r

version control and github
during this about version control and why its so important to data scientists also how to use git and github to manage version control in data science projects
version control github and git linking github and r studio projects under version control

r markdown scientific thinking and big data
during this final to use r markdown and get an introduction to three concepts that are incredibly important to every successful data scientist asking good questions experimental design and big data

getting and cleaning data
before you can with data you have to get some this will cover the basic ways that data can be obtained the will cover obtaining data from the web from apis from databases and from colleagues in various formats it will also cover the basics of data cleaning and how to make data tidy tidy data dramatically speed downstream data analysis tasks the will also cover the components of a complete data set including raw data processing instructions codebooks and processed data the will cover the basics needed for collecting cleaning and sharing data


first of the we look at finding data and reading different file types
obtaining data motivation raw and processed data components of tidy data downloading files reading local files reading excel files reading xml reading json the datatable package


welcome to of getting and cleaning data the primary goal is to introduce you to the most common data storage systems and the appropriate tools to extract data from web or from databases like mysql
reading from mysql reading from hdf reading from the web reading from apis reading from other sources


welcome to of getting and cleaning data the lectures will focus on organizing merging and managing the data you have collected using the lectures from weeks and
subsetting and sorting summarizing data creating new variables reshaping data managing data frames with dplyr introduction managing data frames with dplyr basic tools merging data


welcome to of getting and cleaning data we finish up with lectures on text and date manipulation in r final also focus on peer grading of projects
editing text variables regular expressions i regular expressions ii working with dates data resources

exploratory data analysis
this covers the essential exploratory techniques for summarizing data these techniques are typically applied before formal modeling commences and can help inform the development of more complex statistical models exploratory techniques are also important for eliminating or sharpening potential hypotheses about the world that can be addressed by the data cover in detail the plotting systems in r as as some of the basic principles of constructing data graphics also cover some of the common multivariate statistical techniques used to visualize highdimensional data


covers the basics of analytic graphics and the base plotting system in r weve also included some background material to help you install r if you havent done so already
