excel power tools for data analysis
welcome to excel power tools for data analysis fourweek we introduce power query power pivot and power bi three power tools for transforming analysing and presenting dataexcels ease and flexibility have long made it a tool of choice for doing data analysis but it does have some inherent limitations for one truly big data simply does not fit in a spreadsheet and for another the process of importing and cleaning data can be a repetitive timeconsuming and errorprone over the last few years microsoft have worked on transforming the endtoend for analysts and excel has undergone a major upgrade with the inclusion of power query and power pivot we will how to use power query to automate the process of importing and preparing data for analysis we will see how power pivot revolutionises the actual analysis process by providing us with an analytical database inside the excel workbook capable of storing millions of rows and a powerful modelling language called dax which allows us to perform advanced analytics on our data we will finish off by venturing out of excel and introducing power bi which also uses the power query and power bi architecture but allows us to create stunning interactive reports and dashboards this is the third in our on data analytics and visualization the previous courses excel fundamentals for data analysis and data visualization in excel cover data preparation cleaning visualisation and creating dashboards to get the most out of this we would recommend you do the previous courses or have with these topics we focus on excel power tools join us for this exciting journey please note that power query power pivot and power bi desktop are only available on the windows platform so mac users will require bootcamp running windows or a virtual machine with a window os while power query is available as an addin excel and the tools have changed significantly and this has only been designed and tested for excel and later for an optimal we recommend office

welcome and critical information
welcome to excel power tools for data analysis about importing and transforming data with power query working with huge datasets in power pivot and creating interactive reports with power bi this introductory material will help orient you into the we encourage you to think about your goals for the and share them with your fellow learners

get and transform power query
often the first steps when analysing data are to import the data and combine different datasets together in excel you can use get and transform previously known as power query to help with this how to import data from various sources and the different ways to combine datasets depending on your requirements
introduction introduction to power query get and transform data from excel get data from a database get data from a folder append queries with datasets append queries with or more datasets merge queries left outer join merge queries inner and anti joins

transforming data in the query editor
once your data is imported and combined you then move on to transforming it a common operation is to pivot data between wide and long formats you can group data and split a column into multiple columns power query has a few extra options that a normal pivottable doesnt have
introduction applying transformations with the query editor unpivoting data pivoting data in the query editor grouping data working with columns in office working with columns in excel

power pivot and the data model
an excel workbook can handle up to million rows which sounds like a lot but sometimes you have more data than that the data model in excel is only limited by the amount of memory your computer has you can also define databaselike relationships between tables then you can visualise your data using power pivot and cube functions and create pivottables
introduction adding data to the data model data modelling analysing data with power pivot visualising data with power pivot and cube functions introduction to dax measures applying time intelligence and calculate

visualising data with power bi
we are moving out of excel with this power bi is microsofts business intelligence tool you can put into practice the that you have learned in power query m and dax to create dynamic and interactive reports and dashboards in power bi once you have the report looking how you want share it with others
introduction introducing power bi adding a calendar using dax creating a power bi report working with reports adding time intelligence sharing power bi reports

data visualization in excel
in an age now driven by big data we need to cut through the noise and present key information in a way that can be quickly consumed and acted upon making data visualization an increasingly important visualizations need to not only present data in an easy to understand and attractive way but they must also provide context for the data tell a story achieving that fine balance between form and function excel has many rivals space but it is still an excellent choice particularly if its where your data resides it offers a wealth of tools for creating visualizations other than charts and the chart options available are constantly increasing and improving so the newer versions now include waterfall charts sunburst diagrams and even map charts but what sets excel apart is its flexibility it gives us total creative control over our designs so if needed we could produce our own animated custom chart to tell the right story for our dataover five weeks we will explore excels rich selection of visualization tools using practical case studies as seen through the eyes of rohan an environmental analyst rohan is required to produce visualizations that will show trends forecasts breakdowns and comparisons for a large variety of environmental data sets as well as utilising the usual chart types he wants to use conditional formats sparklines specialised charts and even create his own animated charts and infographics in some cases he will also need to prepare the data using pivot tables to drill down and answer very specific questions we are going to help him achieve all this and present our finished visualizations in attractive reports and dashboards that use tools like slicers and macros for automation and interactivity these are the topics we will cover dynamic visualizations with conditional formatting custom number formatting sparklines and macros charting techniques for telling the right story creating specialised and custom charts summarising and filtering data with pivot tables and pivot charts creating interactive dashboards in excel this is the second in our on data analytics and visualization the first excel fundamentals for data analysis covers data preparation and cleaning but also teaches some of the prerequisites for this like tables and named ranges as well as text lookup and logical functions to get the most out of this we would recommend you do the first or have with these topics we focus on data visualization in excel join us for this exciting journey
