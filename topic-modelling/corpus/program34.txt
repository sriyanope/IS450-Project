bayesian statistics from concept to data analysis
this introduces the bayesian approach to statistics starting with the concept of probability and moving to the analysis of data we will about the philosophy of the bayesian approach as well as how to implement it for common types of data we will compare the bayesian approach to the more commonlytaught frequentist approach and see some of the benefits of the bayesian approach in particular the bayesian approach allows for better accounting of uncertainty results that have more intuitive and interpretable meaning and more explicit statements of assumptions this combines lecture computer demonstrations exercises and discussion boards to create an active for computing you have the choice of using microsoft excel or the opensource freely available statistical package r with equivalent content for both options the lectures provide some of the basic mathematical development as well as explanations of philosophy and interpretation completion of this will give you an understanding of the concepts of the bayesian approach understanding the key differences between bayesian and frequentist approaches and the ability to do basic data analyses
