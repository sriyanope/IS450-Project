computational social science
for more information please view the computational social science traileropens in a new tab digital technology has not only revolutionized society but also the way we can study it currently this is taken advantage of by the most valuable companies in silicon valley the most powerful governmental agencies and the most influential social movements what they have in common is that they use computational tools to understand and ultimately influence human behavior and social dynamics an increasing part of human interaction leaves a massive digital footprint behind studying it allows us to gain unprecedented insights into what society is and how it works including its intricate social networks that had long been obscure computational power allows us to detect hidden patterns through analytical tools like machine and to natural language processing finally computer simulations enable us to explore hypothetical situations that may not even exist in reality but that we would like to exist a better world this serves as a multidisciplinary multiperspective and multimethod guide on how to better understand society and human behavior with modern research tools this gives you easy access to some of the exciting new possibilities of how to study society and human behavior it is the first online collectively taught by professors from all university of california campusesopens in a new tab while no formal requisites are necessary to join this at the end webscrape big data from the web execute a social network analysis sna find hidden patterns with machine ml and natural language processing nlp and create agentbased computer models abm to explore what might happen if we would change certain things in society

social network analysis
this is designed to quite literally make a science out of something at the heart of society social networks humans are natural network scientists as we compute new network configurations all the time almost unaware when thinking about friends and family which are particular forms of social networks about colleagues and organizational relations other overlapping network structures and about how to navigate delicate or opportunistic network configurations to save guard or advance in our social standing with society being one big social network itself while such network structures always existed computational social science has helped to reveal and to study them more systematically in the first part of the we focus on network structure this looks as static snapshots of networks which can be intricate and reveal important aspects of social systems in our handson lab also visualize and analyze a network with a software yourself which will help to appreciate the complexity social networks can take on during the second part of the we will look at how networks evolve in time we ask how we can predict what kind of network will form and if and how we could influence network dynamics

computer simulations
big data and artificial intelligence get most of the press about computational social science but maybe the most complex aspect of it refers to using computational tools to explore and develop social science theory this shows how computer simulations are being used to explore the realm of what is theoretically possible computer simulations allow us to study why societies are the way they are and to dream about the world we would like to live can be as intuitive as playing a game much like the wellknown game simcity is used to build and manage an artificial city we use agentbased models to grow and study artificial societies without hurting anyone in the real world computer simulations allow us explore how to make the world a better place we play handson with several practical computer simulation models and explore how we can combine hypothetical models with real world data finally a simple artificial society yourself bottomup this will allow you to feel the complexity that arises when designing social systems while at the same time experiencing the ease with which our new computational tools allow us to pursue such daunting endeavors
