sports performance analytics
sports analytics has emerged as a field of research with increasing popularity propelled in part by the realworld success illustrated by the bestselling book and motion picture moneyball analysis of team and player performance data has continued to revolutionize the sports industry on the field court and ice as as in living rooms among fantasy sports players and online sports gambling
drawing from real data sets in major league baseball mlb the national basketball association nba the national hockey league nhl the english premier league eplsoccer and the indian premier league iplcricket how to construct predictive models to anticipate team and player performance also replicate the success of moneyball using real statistical models use the linear probability model lpm to anticipate categorical variables in sports contests explore how teams collect and organize an athletes performance data with wearable technologies and how to apply machine learning in a sports analytics context
this introduction to the field of sports analytics is designed for sports managers coaches physical therapists as as sports fans who want to understand the science behind athlete performance and game prediction new python programmers and data analysts who are looking for a fun and practical way to apply their python statistics or predictive modeling will enjoy exploring courses series

learners will apply methods and techniques learned to sports datasets to generate their own results rather than relying on the data processing performed by others as a consequence the learner will be empowered to explore their own ideas about sports team performance test them out using the data and so become a producer of sports analytics rather than a consumer

moneyball and beyond
the book moneyball triggered a revolution in the analysis of performance statistics in sports by showing that data analytics could be used to increase team winning percentage this shows how to data using python to test the claims that lie behind the moneyball story and to examine the evolution of moneyball statistics since the book was published the learner is led through the process of calculating baseball performance statistics from publicly available datasets the progresses from the analysis of on base percentage and slugging percentage to more advanced measures derived using the run expectancy matrix such as wins above replacement war by the end of this the learner will be able to use these statistics to conduct their own team and player analyses


we introduce the moneyball story and explore the method used to test that story we begin the process of replicating the moneyball test by establishing the relationship between team winning and and two performance statistics on base percentage obp and slugging percentage slg

wearable technologies and sports analytics
sports analytics now include massive datasets from athletes and teams that quantify both training and competition efforts wearable technology devices are being worn by athletes everyday and provide considerable for an indepth look at the stress and recovery of athletes across entire seasons the capturing of these large datasets has led to new hypotheses and strategies regarding injury prevention as as detailed feedback for athletes to try and optimize training and recovery
this is an introduction to wearable technology devices and their use in training and competition as part of the larger field of sport sciences it includes an introduction to the physiological principles that are relevant to exercise training and sport performance and how wearable devices can be used to help characterize both training and performance it includes access to some large sport team datasets and uses programming in python to explore concepts related to training recovery and performance

introduction to wearable technology
introduce different types of wearable devices that are used by athletes and teams to improve training and recovery start by highlighting what types of sensors are used within the wearable devices and how the data coming from these sensors can provide insights such as training intensity and or physiologic readiness
welcome to the introduction to wearable technology wearable technology sensors the wearables of athletics

external loads of wearable technology
focus on what we have introduced as external measures point out some of the inaccurate assumptions that are made regarding external measures of load and effort in addition outline how the continuous use of wearable devices has led to new for quantifying effort as as in theory reducing injury and improving performance finish by describing the acute to chronic workload and the reasons it has gained a lot of attention in the past several years
external loads of wearable technology training and performance measures predicting and preventing injury

internal measures of wearable technology
dive more into the physiology of training and recovery focusing on what we have introduced as internal measures further explore the use of internal sensors to provide a glimpse of how the individual athlete is responding to the stress induced by training andor competition also highlight the pros and cons of using internal measures to evaluate individual and team training and recovery
internal measures of wearable technology is hr a pass measure of stress what can other measures add what is so magical about heart rate variability evaluating multiple internal measures which is best difference between cheststrap and wriststrap hr data

combination of internal and external wearable technology
we combine external and internal measures to provide a much more nuanced look at training and recovery the external measures can provide a highly quantified evaluation of the movements and motions that have taken place while the internal measures provide feedback about how the athlete is tolerating the training combining them can be instrumental for evaluating performance improvements and preventing or reducing overuse injuries
benefits of combining internal and external meaures evaluating external load relative to the internal load evaluating internal and external measures together to determine metrics

global metrics
discuss the exciting new global metrics that have been developed andor used by many of the consumer devices that are available today although these new metrics are exciting we want to be cognizant of the limitations of these devices therefore discuss what sensors are actually employed to provide these new metrics and highlight where validation is feasible
introduction to the attraction and dangers of global metrics which wearable metrics do we not have a gold standard to compare against which wearable metrics can we actually validate global metrics example sleep score testing the validity of the rem sleep measure via direct measure with sleep study
