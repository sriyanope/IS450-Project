statistical inference and hypothesis testing in data science applications
this will focus on theory and implementation of hypothesis testing especially as it relates to applications in data science students will to use hypothesis tests to make informed decisions from data special attention will be given to the general logic of hypothesis testing error and error rates power simulation and the correct computation and interpretation of pvalues attention will also be given to the misuse of testing concepts especially pvalues and the ethical implications of such misuse

fundamental concepts of hypothesis testing
define a hypothesis test and develop the intuition behind designing a test the language of hypothesis testing which includes definitions of a null hypothesis an alternative hypothesis and the level of significance of a test walk through a very simple test
what is hypothesis testing types of hypotheses normal computations errors in hypothesis testing test statistics and significance a first test

composite tests power functions and pvalues
expand the lessons of to composite hypotheses for both one and twotailed tests define the power function for a test and discuss its interpretation and how it can lead to the idea of a uniformly most powerful test discuss and interpret pvalues as an alternate approach to hypothesis testing
composite hypotheses and level of significance onetailed tests power functions hypothesis testing with pvalues two tailed tests clt a brief review hypothesis tests for proportions

ttests and twosample tests
about the chisquared and t distributions and their relationships to sampling distributions to identify when hypothesis tests based on these distributions are appropriate review the concept of sample variance and derive the ttest additionally derive our first twosample test and apply it to make some decisions about real data
the t and chisquared distributions the sample variance for the normal distribution ttests two sample tests for means two sample ttests for a difference of means welchs ttest and paired data comparing population proportions

beyond normality
consider some problems where the assumption of an underlying normal distribution is not appropriate and will expand our ability to construct hypothesis tests for this case define the concept of a uniformly most powerful ump test whether or not such a test exists for specific problems and revisit some of our earlier tests from and through the ump lens also introduce the fdistribution and its role in testing whether or not two population variances are equal
properties of the exponential distribution two tests best tests ump tests a test for the variance of the normal distribution the fdistribution and a ratio of variances

likelihood ratio tests and chisquared tests
we develop a formal approach to hypothesis testing based on a likelihood ratio that can be more generally applied than any of the tests we have discussed so far pay special attention to the large sample properties of the likelihood ratio especially wilks theorem that will allow us to come up with approximate but easy tests when we have a large sample size close the with two chisquared tests that can be used to test whether the distributional assumptions we have been making throughout this are valid

probability theory foundation for data science
understand the foundations of probability and its relationship to statistics and data science what it means to calculate a probability independent and dependent and conditional events study discrete and continuous random variables and see how this fits with data collection end the with gaussian normal random variables and the central limit theorem and understand its fundamental importance for all of statistics and data science

descriptive statistics and the axioms of probability
understand the foundation of probability and its relationship to statistics and data science what it means to calculate a probability independent and dependent and conditional events study discrete and continuous random variables and see how this fits with data collection end the with gaussian normal random variables and the central limit theorem and understand its fundamental importance for all of statistics and data science
intro to probability axioms of probability counting permutations and combinations

conditional probability
the notion of conditional probability is a very useful concept from probability theory and we introduce the idea of conditioning and bayes formula the fundamental concept of independent event then naturally arises from the notion of conditioning conditional and independent events are fundamental concepts in understanding statistical results
conditional probability and bayes theorem independent events

discrete random variables
the concept of a random variable rv is fundamental and often used in statistics study various named discrete random variables some of their properties and why they are important also calculate the expectation and variance for these random variables
discrete random variables bernoulli and geometric random variables expectation and variance binomial and negative binomial random variables

continuous random variables
extend our definition of random variables to include continuous random variables the concepts unit are crucial since a substantial portion of statistics deals with the analysis of continuous random variables begin with uniform and exponential random variables and then study gaussian or normal random variables
continuous random variables the gaussian normal random variable part the normal random variable part the poisson and exponential random variables

joint distributions and covariance
the power of statistics lies in being able to study the and effects of multiple random variables ie sometimes referred to as data thus about the concept of joint distribution which allows us to generalize probability theory to the multivariate case
covariance and correlation more on expectation and variance jointly distributed random variables

the central limit theorem
the central limit theorem clt is a crucial result used in the analysis of data introduce the clt and its applications such as characterizing the distribution of the mean of a large data set this will set the stage for the next
introduction to the central limit theorem central limit theorem examples
