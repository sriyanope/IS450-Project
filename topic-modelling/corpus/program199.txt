introduction to cybersecurity essentials
with this beginner friendly fundamental cybersecurity that are crucial for anyone using computing devices and connecting to the internet
first to recognize common security threats and risks that individuals and organizations may face such as theft tampering and destruction of sensitive information then discover the characteristics of cyberattacks and how you can employ best practices to guard against them next about the best practices against cyberattacks these include using strong passwords good password management and multifactor authentication ways in which you can strengthen your security plan with techniques like device hardening encryption and more then about safe browsing practices gain an understanding of why you must practice safe browsing
to protect yourself against hackers phishing identity theft security leaks privacy issues and more also explore methods for securing and managing confidential information then discover how to configure browsers to help reduce security breaches throughout this complete many handson labs which will enhance your understanding of material at the end of this have the to complete a final project where demonstrate your proficiency in cybersecurity designed specifically for beginners and those who are interested in a cybersecurity specialist or analyst roles as as entrylevel roles in information security infosec engineering this dives into the world of cybersecurity to give you the critical employers need it also supports the needs of technical and it support roles who can find themselves on the front lines of defense for cybersecurity issues

common security threats and risks
cybersecurity is the practice of protecting systems networks and programs from digital attacks these attacks typically include business interruptions or the theft tampering or destruction of sensitive information ransomware attacks are on the rise and are predicted to cost victims more than billion usd annually by and that is just one type of threat we all need to protect against the need for organizations to implement effective security practices has never been more important or urgent this will teach you the you need to identify basic security threats and choose the best security practices to address those threats the difference between data information and insights and how companies leverage all three to help guide their business decisions how to maintain data integrity and keep data confidential also begin to about the different types of attacks and breaches that threaten todays organizations and their data
introduction confidentiality integrity and availability security and information privacy threats and breaches microsoft windows server lab environment threat types phishing social engineering and other attacks

security best practices
unfortunately theres no single solution for effective cybersecurity the best practice is to use multiple layers of security some great first steps you can take to improve security and build a solid foundation to protect against cyberattacks are to use strong passwords good password management and multifactor authentication you should also limit access to data and resources to only those people who need them your security plan can be further rounded out and strengthened by using techniques such as device hardening and encryption and by educating employees about cyberthreats as a regular part of their training more about security including password management creating effective passwords and securing devices the differences between authentication authorization and accounting and how these concepts help secure devices and validate logons also how encryption can help secure data transmissions and how to manage email and spam
password management techniques authentication and sso security threats access control authorization and authentication hardening devices security threats validation and device usage security threats encryption concepts managing email and spam

safe browsing practices
from people to computers to mobile phones and the internet of things everything is connected today there are more devices than people for some mobile phones and tablets have replaced traditional desktop computers and laptops the web is where people and businesses get things done and its always on hours a day the internet can be an awesome place to go for entertainment learning and other online but the internet isnt safe hackers phishing identity theft security leaks privacy issues and more are valid reasons to consistently practice safe browsing to protect yourself about safety concerns with applications and public browsing including managing plugins extensions and toolbars about web browser security configurations cookies and computer caches

networking fundamentals
computer networking plays a vital role in facilitating the communication required in almost every aspect of daily life activities like talking with friends and family collaborating with coworkers paying bills and even completing transactions at a store often depend on some form of computer networking computer networking is defined as the connection of people through the use of devices and cables and sometimes wireless signals about the basic types and shapes of networks and how they are used also about wired connections wireless connections and network cables and finally about the advantages and disadvantages of each network type
introduction network types and topologies from wired to wireless internet connections cables wireless connections advantages and disadvantages of network types

networking fundamentals part ii
understanding the foundations of how all networks behave is achieved by investigating the rules that includes finding out how each rule works and observing how each rule is applied to the network and how the network is affected by that rule about networking devices and the basic instructions they follow to connect us in the ways we expect understand how data is packaged electronically which rules are used to send the data how those rules are made and how computers determine where to send those data packages
networking hardware devices packets ip addressing dns dhcp and nat microsoft windows server lab environment models standards protocols and ports wireless networks and standards protocol table

configuring and troubleshooting networks
one of the key components of communicating is understanding how to communicate that includes knowing what enables communication and what blocks it this is just as true for computer networking as it is for persontoperson interactions if you dont understand the ways to get data from one point to another the data will never arrive where you want it to the basic steps for setting up small office or home office networksincluding wired wireless and mobile configurations explore network settings in windows and then what causes network connectivity problems and how to resolve those problems finally how command line utilities can be used to find network information and diagnose network issues
configuring a wired soho network configuring a wireless soho network mobile configurations network settings in windows troubleshooting network connectivity network troubleshooting with command line utilities

storage types and network sharing
as weve discussed connection plays a vital role in communication another key component in communication is memory information is not useful if it cant be recalled network storage is where the memory is located in computer networking about different types of network storage and basic storage troubleshooting about shortterm and longterm memory and the different ways that memory can be arranged to increase capacity and efficiency also about local offsite and cloud memory and how all these different kinds of memory enable faster and more efficient interaction between people devices and software
types of local storage devices local storage with multiple drives troubleshooting storage issues types of hosted storage and sharing network storage types cloudbased storage devices
