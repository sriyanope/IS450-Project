</DOC>
<DOC>extract data
the first truly handson technical phase of the data science process is actually a combination of related tasks known as extract transform and load etl this is where you the data science practitioner start to mold and shape the data so that it can be as useful as possible for the later steps in the data science process go through each etl task in order starting with e extract
