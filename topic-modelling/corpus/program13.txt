communicating business analytics results
the analytical process does not end with models than can predict with accuracy or prescribe the best solution to business problems developing these models and gaining insights from data do not necessarily lead to successful implementations this depends on the ability to communicate results to those who make decisions presenting findings to decision makers who are not familiar with the language of analytics presents a challenge how to communicate analytics results to stakeholders who do not understand the details of analytics but want evidence of analysis and data be able to choose the right vehicles to present quantitative information including those based on principles of data visualization also how to develop and deliver dataanalytics stories that provide context insight and interpretation
