hypothesisdriven development
to deliver agile you have to do more than implement agile processes you have to create focus around what matters to your user and constantly test your ideas this is easier said than done but most of todays highfunctioning innovators have a strong culture of experimentation
how to identify the right questions at the right time and pair them with the right methods to do just enough testing to make sure you minimize waste and maximize the you create with your user this is supported by the batten institute at uvas darden school of business the batten institutes mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation wwwbatteninstituteorg

<DOC>how do we know if were building for a user that doesnt exist
how do you go from backlog grooming to blockbuster results with agile hypothesisdriven decisions specifically you need to shift your teammates focus from their natural tendency to focus on their own output to focusing out user easier said than done but getting everyone excited about results of an experiment is one of the most reliable ways to get there focus on how you get started in a practical way
introduction hypothesesdriven development your product pipeline introducing example company hvac in a hurry driving with your product pipeline the persona hypothesis the jtbd hypothesis the demand hypothesis the usability hypothesis the collaboration hypothesis the functional hypothesis driving to value with your persona jtbd hypothesis example personas and jobstobedone setting up interviews prepping for subject interviews conducting the interview how not to interview day in the life you and your next design sprint the practice of time boxing of the persona and jtbd sprint how do i sell the idea of a design sprint your persona jtbd hypotheses whats next for you

<DOC>how do we reduce waste increase wins by testing our propositions before we build them
nothing will help a team deliver better like making sure theyre building something the user values this might sound simple or obvious but i think after its likely find to help improve your teams focus by testing ideas more definitively before you invest in developing software how to make concept testing an integral part of your product pipeline continue to apply methods from lean startup looking at how they pair with agile look at how highfunctioning teams design and run situationappropriate experiments to test ideas and how that works before the fact when youre testing an idea and after the fact when youre testing the value of software youve released

<DOC>how do we invest to move fast
youve learned how to test ideas and usability to reduce the amount of software your team needs to build and to focus its execution now youre going to how highfunctioning teams approach testing of the software itself the practice of continuous delivery and the closely related devops movement are changing the way we build and release software it wasnt that long ago where releases a year was considered standard now amazon for example releases code every seconds look at the delivery pipeline and step through what successful practitioners do at each stage and how you can diagnose and apply the practices that will improve your implementation of agile
