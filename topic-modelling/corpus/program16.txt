hypothesisdriven development
to deliver agile you have to do more than implement agile processes you have to create focus around what matters to your user and constantly test your ideas this is easier said than done but most of todays highfunctioning innovators have a strong culture of experimentationin this how to identify the right questions at the right time and pair them with the right methods to do just enough testing to make sure you minimize waste and maximize the you create with your user this is supported by the batten institute at uvas darden school of business the batten institutes mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation wwwbatteninstituteorg

how do we know if were building for a user that doesnt exist
how do you go from backlog grooming to blockbuster results with agile hypothesisdriven decisions specifically you need to shift your teammates focus from their natural tendency to focus on their own output to focusing out user easier said than done but getting everyone excited about results of an experiment is one of the most reliable ways to get there well focus on how you get started in a practical way
introduction hypothesesdriven development your product pipeline introducing example company hvac in a hurry driving with your product pipeline the persona hypothesis the jtbd hypothesis the demand hypothesis the usability hypothesis the collaboration hypothesis the functional hypothesis driving to value with your persona jtbd hypothesis example personas and jobstobedone setting up interviews prepping for subject interviews conducting the interview how not to interview day in the life you and your next design sprint the practice of time boxing overview of the persona and jtbd sprint how do i sell the idea of a design sprint your persona jtbd hypotheses whats next for you

how do we reduce waste increase wins by testing our propositions before we build them
nothing will help a team deliver better like making sure theyre building something the user values this might sound simple or obvious but i think after its likely find to help improve your teams focus by testing ideas more definitively before you invest in developing software how to make concept testing an integral part of your product pipeline well continue to apply methods from lean startup looking at how they pair with agile well look at how highfunctioning teams design and run situationappropriate experiments to test ideas and how that works before the fact when youre testing an idea and after the fact when youre testing the value of software youve released

how do we consistently deliver great usability
the best products are tested for usability early and often avoiding the destructive stress and uncertainty of a big unveil how to diagnose design and execute phaseappropriate user testing the tools to use here a test plan template prototyping tool and test session infrastructure are accessibleteachable to anyone on your team and thats a very good thing often products are released with poor usability because there wasnt enough time to test it with these techniques be able to test early and often reinforcing your culture of experimentation
the always test a testdriven approach to usability the inexact science of interface design diagnosing usability with donald normans steps model fixing usability with donald normans steps model applying the steps model to hypothesisdriven development fixing the visceral layer fixing the behavioral layer the importance of comparables prototyping prototyping with balsamiq usability testing fun affordable the right testing at the right time a test plan anyone can use creating good test items running a usability design sprint running a usability design sprint skit interview laura klein on qualitative vs quantitative research interview laura klein on lean ux in enterprise it prioritizing user with story mapping your usability hypotheses whats next for you

how do we invest to move fast
youve learned how to test ideas and usability to reduce the amount of software your team needs to build and to focus its execution now youre going to how highfunctioning teams approach testing of the software itself the practice of continuous delivery and the closely related devops movement are changing the way we build and release software it wasnt that long ago where releases a year was considered standard now amazon for example releases code every seconds well look at the delivery pipeline and step through what successful practitioners do at each stage and how you can diagnose and apply the practices that will improve your implementation of agile

agile meets design thinking
despite everyones good intentions hard and solid ideas too many teams end up creating products that no one wants no one can use and no one buys but it doesnt have to be this way agile and design thinking offer a differentand effectiveapproach to product development one that results in valuable solutions to meaningful problems how to determine whats valuable to a user early in the processto frontload valueby focusing your team on testable narratives about the user and creating a strong shared perspective this is supported by the batten institute at uvas darden school of business the batten institutes mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation wwwbatteninstituteorg

focusing your agile with personas jobstobedone and alternatives
the best way to avoid building something nobody wants is to start with somebody in mind in the design world we talk about that somebody through a persona personas and problem scenarios aka jobstobedone focus development on driving toward a valuable for your user vs just generating output to focus your by developing personas problem scenarios and alternatives using best practices from design thinking
