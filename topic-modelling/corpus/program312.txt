python bash and sql essentials for data engineering
if you are interested in developing the needed to be a data engineer the python bash and sql essentials for data engineering is a great place to start we live in a world that is driven by big data from what we search online to the route we take to our favorite restaurant and everything in between businesses and organizations use this data to make decisions that impact the ways in which we navigate our lives how do engineers collect this data how can this data be organized so that it can be appropriately analyzed a data engineer is specialized initial step of accessing cleaning and managing big data
data engineers today need a solid foundation in a few essential areas python bash and sql in python bash and sql essentials for data engineering we provide a nuts and bolts of these fundamental needed for entering the world of data engineering led by three data engineers this will provide quick and accessible ways to data engineering strategies give you a chance to practice what youve learned in integrated lab exercises and then immediately apply these techniques in your or academic life


each includes integrated lab exercises using visual studio code or jupyter notebooks that give you an to practice the python bash and sql with realworld applications covered in each for each data engineering solution that you explore you are also encouraged to create a demo and github repository of code that can be showcased in your digital portfolio for employers by the end of this have the foundational necessary to begin tackling more complex data engineering solutions
