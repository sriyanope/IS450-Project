user interface design
industrystandard theory and methods for developing successful user interfaces uis upon completing this have fluency with the user research prototyping and evaluation techniques necessary for creating intuitive interfaces that facilitate good user also have demonstrated this fluency through an indepth capstone project that can be shown to prospective employers in the fastgrowing field of ui design
concepts and techniques covered include structured approaches for helping you understand your user base and their needs eg contextual inquiry and design psychology widelyemployed prototyping and design methods eg lowfidelity and paper prototyping and robust techniques for helping you evaluate your design choices eg heuristic evaluation and user studies by the end of the be comfortable applying these concepts and techniques to design an interface for a wide variety of users from around the world

introduction to ui design
gain an understanding of the critical importance of user interface design also industrystandard methods for how to approach the design of a user interface and key theories and frameworks that underlie the design of most interfaces you use today
through a series of case studies on commercial systems many of which you likely use on a regular basis illustrate the benefits of good design also demonstrate how the costs of bad design can often be severe in user money and even human lives then gain a highlevel understanding of the userinterface design process be introduced to common design scenarios eg improving on existing designs and starting a new design from scratch and the general design processes that tend to be used for each scenario finally begin introducing the large body of existing knowledge on design by providing overviews of core user interface design theories and concepts this key foundational information will help you avoid reinventing the wheel when you are designing your interfaces

evaluating user interfaces
and practice several techniques for user interface evaluation first we start with techniques that can be applied alone or in a design team including action analysis walkthroughs and heuristic evaluation then we move on to user testing including learning from a series of usability tests carried out in a real usability lab and techniques to carry out your own tests even without a lab finally we wrap up the discussion of evaluationand of ui design in the as a wholeby looking at the question of how to set and measure usability goals and in turn when a design is usable enough to release it
