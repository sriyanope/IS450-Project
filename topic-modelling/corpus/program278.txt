networking in google cloud
this gives participants broad study of core infrastructure and networking options on google cloud platform through recorded lectures demonstrations and handson labs participants explore and deploy gcp networking technologies such as google virtual private cloud vpc networks subnets firewalls
interconnection among networks
load balancing
cloud dns
cloud cdn the will also cover common network design patterns and automated deployment using deployment manager
this class is intended for the following participants
network engineers and admins who are either using google cloud platform or are planning to do so
individuals who want to be exposed to softwaredefined networking solutions in the cloud
to get the most out of this participants should have
prior understanding of the osi layer model
prior understanding of ipv addressing
prior with managing ipv routes

this incorporates handson labs using our qwiklabs platform these hands on components will let you apply the you in the lectures projects will incorporate topics such as google cloud platform products which are used and configured within qwiklabs you can expect to gain practical handson with the concepts explained throughout the
