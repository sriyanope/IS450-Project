imagebased research
welcome we will introduce imagebased research and investigate these images in a design context using a range of techniques then choose a subject of your own to research that will become the basis for your experiments and designs in the coming weeks
welcome why peer review peer review tips how to apply feedback practice what images do considering the book in a graphic design context

making images
is a making session take the subject you selected last and think about it in different ways from simple to complex hand to digital realistic to abstract and everything in between well explore and experiment freely well also consider different modes of representation and try a hand at creating our own ranges of representation with images
