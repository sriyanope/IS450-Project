learners will engage in interactive exercises throughout this that offers to practice and implement what they are learning they will directly in the azure portal and use the microsoft sandbox this is a free environment that allows learners to explore microsoft azure and get handson with live microsoft azure resources and services for example when you about training a deep neural network
in a temporary azure environment called the sandbox the beauty about this is that be working with real technology but in a controlled environment which allows you to apply what you and at your own pace need a microsoft account if you dont have one you can create one for free the sandbox allows free fixedtime access to a cloud subscription with no credit card required learners can safely explore create and manage resources without the fear of incurring costs or breaking production
