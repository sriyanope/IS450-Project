gis mapping and spatial analysis
this is for those new to mapping and gis as as anyone looking to gain a better understanding of how it all works and why practical that can be applied to your own using cuttingedge software created by esri inc the worlds leading gis company and our industry partner
please note the software is no longer provided with this have to obtain it on your own these courses were designed to be taken with arcmap which is no longer supported by esri and so you may not be able to obtain it unless your institution or company already has it

the courses are based on the idea that get the most out of the learning if you can tailor your to your own interests how to create gis data how to find and evaluate data found online how to design an effective map and how to filter data and analyze spatial relationships and how to with satellite imagery in the capstone apply everything you have learned by either building a portfolio of your through mini projects or planning and executing one large project your capstone will then be presented in a webbased story map that you can share with your friends family and colleagues

gis data acquisition and map design
how to find gis data for your own projects and how to create a welldesigned map that effectively communicates your message the first section focuses on the basic building blocks of gis data so that you know what types of gis files exist and the implications of choosing one type over another next discuss metadata which is information about a data set so you know how to evaluate a data set before you decide to use it as as preparing data by merging and clipping files as needed then talk about how to take nongis data such as a list of addresses and convert it into mappable data using geocoding finally about how to take data that you have found and design a map using cartographic principles in the project find your own data and create your own quantitative map

introduction to gis mapping
get started learning about the fascinating and useful world of geographic information systems gis first of the gis mapping and spatial analysis about what a gis is how to get started with the software yourself how things we find in the real world can be represented on a map how we record locations using coordinates and how we can make a twodimensional map from a threedimensional earth in the project create your own gis data by tracing geographic features from a satellite image for a location and theme of your choice this will give you a strong foundation in mapping and gis that will give you the understanding you need to start working with gis and to succeed in the other courses
this is for anyone who wants to about mapping and gis you dont have to have any previous just your curiosity the includes both practical software training and explanations of the concepts you need to know to make informed decisions as you start your journey to becoming a gis analyst need a windows computer with arcgis desktop installed software is not provided

spatial analysis and satellite imagery in a gis
how to analyze map data using different data types and methods to answer geographic questions first how to filter a data set using different types of queries to find just the data you need to answer a particular question then discuss simple yet powerful analysis methods that use vector data to find spatial relationships within and between data sets section also about how to use modelbuilder a simple but powerful tool for building analysis flowcharts that can then also be run as models then how to find understand and use remotely sensed data such as satellite imagery as a rich source of gis data then how to analyze raster data finally complete your own project where you get to try out the new and tools you have learned about

gis mapping and spatial analysis capstone
capstone apply everything you have learned by designing and then completing your own gis project plan out your project by writing a brief proposal that explains what you plan to do and why then find data for a topic and location of your choice and perform analysis and create maps that allow you to try out different tools and data sets the results of your will be assembled into an esri story map which is a web site with maps images text and the goal is for you to have a finished product that you can share and that demonstrates what you have learned
