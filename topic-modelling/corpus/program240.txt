leverage data science for a more agile supply chain
over the past two decades the supply chain has become more complex while advancing technology has allowed companies to capture this complexity within stores of ever accumulating data companies have not kept up with how to analyze and derive insights from that data this uses handson activities to show how data science techniques can turn raw data into decisionmakers for a more agile supply chain foundational techniques such as demand forecasting inventory management with demand variability and using the newsvendor model are covered in addition to more advanced techniques such as how to optimize for capacity and resources as as mitigate risks with the monte carlo simulation by the end of this be able to
describe how demand planning supply planning and constrained forecast are associated with one another
use excel to analyze historical data to quantify future needs
analyze historical data to determine inventory levels in steady and uncertain demand situations using excel
manage inventory in an uncertain environment
quantify the inventory needs for singleperiod items using the newsvendor model
identify the components of capacity optimization resource optimization and monte carlo simulation
set up and solve optimization problems in excel
build a demand and inventory snapshot and run a monte carlo simulation to solve for a more agile supply chain

throughout the learners with realworld supply chain data to analyze various supply chain scenarios to close learners apply concepts from all three courses to apply learned data science to improve the margins of a supply chain

supply chain optimization
optimization is an important piece of an agile supply chain explore the components of optimization and how to set up an optimization problem in excel also practice capacity and resource optimization and explore examples of both in the supply chain building off of our optimization practice next how to use a monte carlo simulation to make the least risky decision in uncertain supply chain situations finally combine our from this and the previous two courses to build a demand and inventory snapshot and optimize it using a monte carlo simulation to mitigate risks in the supply chain

optimization defined
welcome to optimization defined the word optimization has filled our lives in the last decade everywhere we turn we either hear or see the word optimization especially for those involved in marketing supply chain and operations define optimization and describe its purpose in the supply chain also identify the components of an optimization algorithm and see how to use an objective function in excel in our activity practice formulating a maximization function

capacity optimization
welcome to capacity optimization in the previous we described optimization in general and saw how to set up an optimization problem in excel over these next two dive into two specific examples of optimization capacity optimization and resource optimization identify the goal of capacity optimization and some examples of how it can be used in the supply chain also demo the steps to create a capacity optimization problem in excel and recall these steps for our quiz in our activity describe how everyday tasks or functions can benefit from capacity optimization

resource optimization
welcome to resource optimization identify the goal of resource optimization how it differs from capacity optimization and go through some industry examples how to set up a resource optimization problem in excel through our demo and recall these steps in our quiz finally put what weve learned into practice by setting up and solving a resource optimization problem in excel

monte carlo simulation
welcome to monte carlo simulation define a monte carlo simulation and when it should be used through our demo how to set up a monte carlo simulation in excel which will prepare us to identify the key inputs and excel features needed to run a monte carlo simulation for our quiz as a close to this this has a peergraded in our practice the learned in all three courses to build a demand and inventory snapshot and then use a monte carlo simulation to minimize costs finally in our discussion reflect on how learned through the past three courses can be applied to our current or future careers

supply chain planning
supply chain planning is an important activity in any supply chain this is where organizations get an idea of the upcoming demand realize if they have the capacity to meet the demand and determine how to realize these demands explore how to use data science to conduct demand and supply planning how to constrain the forecast and how to measure the results as we walk through this process also explore how to use excel to quantify each step

demand planning
welcome to demand planning explore demand planning how to identify influencing factors how to differentiate between the three simple statistical forecast types and how to compute a few forecast values
influencing factors develop statistical demand forecast

supply planning
welcome to supply planning discuss the basics of supply planning how to confirm internal external capacity how to confirm material availability and the importance of communication and data sharing to supply planning

constrained forecast
welcome to constrained forecast discuss constrained forecasts and consensus meetings specifically cover the purpose and creation of constrained forecasts and how consensus meetings are utilized to reach organizational goals

measure results
welcome to measure results discuss measuring results through collecting actual performance results and calculating forecast errors specifically discuss the purpose of measuring results the types of metrics used when measuring results and common error measurements and their advantages and disadvantages

inventory management
inventory is a strategic asset for organizations the effective management of inventory can minimize a companys spending while dramatically increasing its profit explore how to use data science to manage inventory in uncertain environments how to set inventory levels based on customer service requirements and how to calculate inventory for products that have short sales cycles

steadystate demand no demand variability
welcome to steadystate demand no demand variability begin by discussing demand behavior specifically steadystate demand next explore lead time and gather lead time information from multiple stakeholders the will close with a demonstration of how to calculate a reorder point within excel

inventory management with demand variability
welcome to after discussing steadystate demand in explore the more common situation of demand variability specifically focus on sources of variability strategies for countering variability and lead time calculations to maintain a safety stock

inventory as a strategic tool to meet customer service level
welcome to discuss customer service level its relationship to inventory and how to calculate safety stock to maintain a desired customer service level

newsvendor model oneperiod decision model
welcome to cover the newsvendor model examples of singleperiod products and calculating the order quantity to mitigate product underages or overages
