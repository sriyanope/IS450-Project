ethical issues in data science
computing applications involving large amounts of data the domain of data science impact the lives of most people in the us and the world these impacts include recommendations made to us by internetbased systems information that is available about us online techniques that are used for security and surveillance data that is used in health care and many more in many cases they are affected by techniques in artificial intelligence and machine learning
this examines some of the ethical issues related to data science with the fundamental objective of making data science professionals aware of and sensitive to ethical considerations that may arise in their careers it does this through a combination of discussion of ethical frameworks examination of a variety of data science applications that lead to ethical considerations reading current media and scholarly articles and drawing upon the perspectives and of fellow students and computing professionals ethical issues in data science can be taken for academic credit as part of cu boulders master of science in data science msds degree offered on the coursera platform the msds is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from cu boulders departments of applied mathematics computer science information science and others with performancebased admissions and no application process the msds is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education andor in computer science information science mathematics and statistics

ethical foundations
this begins with an introduction to the including motivation for the topic the goals what topics the will cover and what is expected of the students it then reviews the three ethical frameworks that are most commonly applied to ethical discussions in data science and computing kantianismdeontology virtue ethics and utilitarianism case studies are used to illustrate the application and properties of these frameworks
