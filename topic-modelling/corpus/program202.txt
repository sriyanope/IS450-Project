conversations that inspire coaching leadership and change
coaching can inspire and motivate people to change and be effective leaders among other roles in life although most attempts are coaching for compliance coaching someone to your wishes or expectations decades of behavioral and neuroscience research show us that coaching with compassion coaching someone to their dreams and desires is more effective

how do people really help others
the best coaches develop resonant relationships which involve the of hope and compassion and the arousal of meaning we explore how effective coaches inspire others and use an approach based on compassion rather than compliance to promote positive enduring change in their coachees we then turn to intentional change theory ict as a model of sustained desired change at all levels of human endeavor detailing the five discovery phases that comprise ict finally we explore the positive and negative emotional attractors pea and nea their relationship to the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems sns and pns and how arousal of either of these systems can deferentially lead to either feelings of negativity and fear or a focus on ones strengths and the excitement of experimenting with something new
watch introduction watch introduction to helping and coaching watch tipping points in the discoveries of sustained desired change watch role of positive and negative emotional attractors

physiology and neuroscience of coaching
chronic stress without regular and period of renewal is nonsustainable for performance we further examine the physiology of the pns and sns including the relationship between stress and the activation of the sns and renewal and the activation of the pns including implications for hormonal and cardiovascular activity in the body we then turn to our neurosciencebased study of coaching outlining the contagious effect of emotions and the relationship between the brains independent and suppresive task positive network tpn and default mode network and how each relates to problem solvinganalytical tasks and social tasksopenness to people and we end by outlining the ethical dimensions of coaching the essentials of trust and environmental safety awareness of boundaries and ensuring that the coaching process flows from the coachee themselves

coaching for the ideal self and relationships
the ideal self is centered on autonomous motivation what a person wants to do and results in sustained desired change conversely the ought self is based on controlled motivation what a person feels they must do based on the standards of others the ideal self comprises hope core identity and an image of a desired future and is fueled by optimism and selfefficacy we then turn to the two forms of empathy empathy with the head a form of conceptual understanding and cognitive processing which implicates both the tpn and dmn and empathy with the heart genuine emphatic concern which engages the dmn alone with our focus on the need to develop emotional selfawareness in order to serve others while appropriately balancing both forms of empathy as the coaching situation demands lastly we explore the notion of genuine listening in a coaching relationship as opposed to mere hearing the other person speak and outline a case for listening beyond the words giving our full attention to the other person to establish what lies beyond the words and what meaning we can derive from what that other person is saying
watch pulling for dreams not just goals whose dream is it watch two forms of empathy watch listening and noticing

coaching for the real self balance and agenda
there is an optimal balance between time spent in the pea and time spent in the nea too much time in the pea may result in overoptimism or complacency with too much time in the nea resulting in diminishment or depression given that negative emotional tend to be stronger and more palpable the ratio between time spent in the two emotional states should be skewed toward the pea at around establishing the real self involves mindful awareness which itself demands soliciting accurate feedback from others so as to establish a personal balance sheet cataloguing the strengths one can leverage within themselves and the shortcomings they may seek to address next we explore the nature and role of social identity groups how they support and enhance emotional contagion and may facilitate the development of a larger or noble purpose in ones ideal self lastly we detail planning and experimentation with new behaviors to promote and sustain new and growth on the part of coachees
