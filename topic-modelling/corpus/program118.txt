drug development product management
pharmaceutical and biotech companies are spending years and millions of dollars developing drugs or promising new biologics all with the hopes of saving or enhancing patients lives this will provide you with a feet view of the entire process of drug discovery and development in the first begin with learning how scientists go from selecting a drug discovery target to filing an initial new drug application in the second the intricacy of drug development from phase to phase clinical trials and filing a new drug application finally in the third the will provide you an understanding of the complexities in launching new pharmaceutical products ensuring sales success and patient access healthcare in the us is unlike any other developed country and this third provides a good for anyone wanting to understand how the us market works
by the end of the have mastered a better understanding of the process of discovering new drugs after completing this if you are interested in pursuing a specializing in drug development and product management you may want to consider exploring our master of science in drug development product management at ddpmucsdedu

the major aspects of the drug discovery process starting with target selection to compound screening to designing lead candidates
product registration and approval process after a drug is considered safe and effective from phase trials it must be authorized in each individual country before it can be marketed

the different stages of clinical development as as the regulatory including but not limited to an investigational new drug application ind new drug application nda and product labeling additionally how to incorporate study design methods for consideration in the design of clinical protocols to assess safety tolerability and efficacy in multiple therapeutic areas the different phases of clinical development phase or early stage clinical trial are conducted primarily to determine how the new drug works in humans its safety profile and to predict its dosage range it typically involves between and healthy volunteers phase or proof of concept poc studies test for efficacy as as safety and side effects in a group of between to hundred patients with the disease for which the new drug is being developed phase or late stage clinical development involve much larger group of patients between a few hundred to thousands depending on the indication which will help determine if the new drug can be considered both safe and effective it will involve control groups using placebo andor current treatment as a comparison product registration and approval process after a drug is considered safe and effective from phase trials it must be authorized in each individual country before it can be marketed all data generated about the small molecule or biologic is collected and submitted to the regulatory authorities in the us at the fda food and drug administration fda in europe the ema or european medicines agency japan ministry of health and other countries which may require their own national approvals this is intended as part of a series drug discovery httpswwwcourseraorglearndrugdiscovery drug development and drug commercialization httpswwwcourseraorglearndrugcommercialization we would highly recommend that you take the courses in order since it will give you a better understanding on how a drug is discovered in the lab before being tested in clinical trials and then launched in the market place

this will cover pharmacoeconomic marketing strategy intellectual property strategy portfolio management managed markets and strategic alliances it will also have a lecture case study from startup to success in addition the will discuss postmarketing clinical trials or phase trials these are conducted after a new drug has been approved by the regulatory agencies and launched in these studies the new drug is prescribed in an everyday healthcare environment using a much larger group of patients this enables new treatment uses for the new drug to be developed comparisons with other treatments for the same indication to be made and determination of the clinical effectiveness of the new drug in a wider variety of patient types and more rare side effects if any may be detected premarketing strategy should be instigated as early as phase clinical trials to ensure that the markets needs are incorporated into the new drugs overall development later phases when clinical results are presented at international medical conferences the marketing strategy is then refined in order to develop an awareness amongst the medical community who will be prescribing the new drug in addition to the marketing strategy pricing strategy and a tactical plan will be developed promotional material and the sales force will be trained so that when the product is approved they can promote the drug to physician pharmacist and nurses this is intended as part of a series drug discovery httpswwwcourseraorglearndrugdiscovery drug development httpswwwcourseraorglearndrugdevelopment and drug commercialization we would highly recommend that you take the courses in order since it will give you a better understanding on how a drug is discovered in the lab before being tested in clinical trials and then launched in the market place
