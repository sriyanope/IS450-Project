ai product management
organizations in every industry are accelerating their use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to create innovative new products and systems this requires professionals across a range of functions not just strictly within the data science and data engineering teams to understand when and how ai can be applied to speak the language of data and analytics and to be capable of working in crossfunctional teams on machine learning projects
this provides a foundational understanding of how machine learning works and when and how it can be applied to solve problems learners will build in applying the data science process and industry best practices to lead machine learning projects and develop competency in designing humancentered ai products which ensure privacy and ethical standards the courses focus on the intuition behind these technologies with no programming required and merge theory with practical information including best practices from industry professionals and aspiring professionals from a diverse range of industries and functions including product managers and product owners engineering team leaders executives analysts and others will find this valuable

learners will implement three projects throughout the of this
in complete a handson project where create a machine learning model to solve a simple problem no coding necessary and assess your models performance
in identify and frame a problem of interest design a machine learning system which can help solve it and begin the development of a project plan
in perform a basic user design exercise for your mlbased solution and analyze the relevant ethical and privacy considerations of the project
