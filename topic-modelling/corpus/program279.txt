neuroscience and neuroimaging
this combines the strength of different neuroscience courses into a cohesive taught by johns hopkins university it begins with fundamental neuroscience concepts for neuroimaging neuroimaging methods are used with increasing frequency in clinical practice and basic research starting with the neuroanatomy of the brain it then moves into principles of neuroimaging including experimental design in neuroimaging functional connectivity mri diffusion tensor imaging and spectroscopy imagingthe then continues with two courses that focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging one of the most widely used techniques for investigating the living functioning human brain as people perform tasks and mental states and a convergence point for multidisciplinary to conclude the moves into implementation of neurohacking using the r programming language with the associated packages to perform data manipulation processing and analysis of neuroimaging data using publicly available structural mriapplied projectlearners will go from fmri data design structure and acquisition to using the r programming language httpscranrprojectorg and its associated package to perform manipulation processing and analysis of neuroimaging data specifically how to readwrite images of the brain in nifti format visualize and explore these images perform inhomogeneity correction brain extraction and image registration within a subject and to a template
