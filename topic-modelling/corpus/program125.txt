ii determine the specific business situations where blockchain technology can be deployed to solve important problems
iii select the specific blockchain technology that has the best chance of success for a particular problem
and iv detail the risks presented by this new technology

<DOC>blockchain
a helicopter tour of the essential concepts of blockchain each of which will be detailed later in the blockchain as a technology is defined in terms of the commonalities present in blockchain applications there is also an introduction to both current and future blockchain applications
introduction blockchain types of blockchains uses of blockchains what blockchains can do targets for disruption applications blockchain ingredients contextualizing blockchain in tech key takeaways
</DOC>

<DOC>cryptographic hashing
almost all blockchains use some sort of cryptographic hashing hashing is a one way function where any input of arbitrary size can be uniquely expressed as a string of characters any change in the input cause the hash to change hashing is a one way function it is easy to go from the input to the hash but extremely difficult to go the other way as such cryptographic hashing should not be confused with encryption where an encrypted message can be decoded
properties of a hashing algorithm applications of hashes modular arithmetic xor sha sha scale of sha information loss in sha brute forcing a sha applications of sha
</DOC>

<DOC>blockchain encryption and signatures
some basic knowledge of encryption techniques is essential for understanding blockchain technology this focuses on digital signature algorithms when a transaction is placed on a blockchain it is signed by the owner with the owners public information and the signature we can quickly determine if the signer is really the owner
monoalphabetic ciphers polyalphabetic ciphers symmetric digital signatures rsa ecc ecdsa quantum signatures
</DOC>

<DOC>bitcoin and other blockchains
bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency and the first large scale use of blockchain technology this explores how the bitcoin blockchain works we detail the mechanics of transactions and there is an introduction to the consensus mechanism called proof of this provides a foundation to look at other blockchain implementations we highlight the difference between bitcoin ethereum and other technologies like hyperledger
the original blockchain hashing in the bitcoin blockchain mining crypto classifications the crypto vision ethereum ethereum under the hood the dao private blockchains
</DOC>

<DOC>using blockchain
with a knowledge of the mechanics of blockchain technology students are now able to determine the usefulness of the technology in various different applications we focus on both the current applications as as applications that are in process but not yet public
addresses bitcoin transactions cryptotransactions in depth cryptotransaction mechanics layer machine to machine
</DOC>

<DOC>consensus
there is no single blockchain technology and there are many ways to implement blockchain technology the choice of technology crucially depends on the application we study proof of proof of stake as as some other mechanisms consensus is an active area of research in the blockchain space
intro to consensus nodes proof of efficient hashing for proof of proof of stake byzantine fault tolerance other consensus algorithms
