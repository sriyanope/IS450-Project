building a data science team
data science is a team sport as a data science executive it is your job to recruit organize and manage the team to success oneweek we will cover how you can find the right people to fill out your data science team how to organize them to give them the best chance to feel empowered and successful and how to manage your team as it grows this is a focused designed to rapidly get you up to speed on the process of building and managing a data science team our goal was to make this as convenient as possible for you without sacrificing any essential content weve left the technical information aside so that you can focus on managing your team and moving it forward after completing this know the different roles in the data science team including data scientist and data engineer how the data science team relates to other teams in an organization what are the expected qualifications of different data science team members relevant questions for interviewing data scientists how to manage the onboarding process for the team how to guide data science teams to success how to encourage and empower data science teams commitment of study hours cover image by jaredzammit creative commons bysa httpsflickrpvuwzz

building a data science team
welcome to building a data science team this is one intended to be taken in one the works best if you follow along with the material in the order it is presented each lecture consists of and reading materials and every lecture has a question quiz you need to get out of or better on the quiz to pass overall the quizzes are worth of your grade each with the exception of the last quiz which is worth im excited to have you in the class and look forward to your contributions to the community click discussions to see forums where you can discuss the material with fellow students taking the class be sure to introduce yourself to everyone in the meet and greet forumif you have questions about content please post them in the forums to get help from others in the community for technical problems with the coursera platform visit the learner help centergood luck as you get started and i hope you enjoy the jeff

data science in real life
have you ever had the perfect data science the data pull went perfectly there were no merging errors or missing data hypotheses were clearly defined prior to analyses randomization was performed for the treatment of interest the analytic plan was outlined prior to analysis and followed exactly the conclusions were clear and actionable decisions were obvious has that every happened to you of not data analysis in real life is messy how does one manage a team facing real data analyses oneweek we contrast the ideal with what happens in real life by contrasting the ideal key concepts that will help you manage real life analyses this is a focused designed to rapidly get you up to speed on doing data science in real life our goal was to make this as convenient as possible for you without sacrificing any essential content weve left the technical information aside so that you can focus on managing your team and moving it forward after completing this know how to describe the perfect data science identify strengths and weaknesses in experimental designs describe possible pitfalls when pulling assembling data and solutions for managing data pulls challenge statistical modeling assumptions and drive feedback to data analysts describe common pitfalls in communicating data analyses get a glimpse into a day in the life of a data analysis manager the will be taught at a conceptual level for active managers of data scientists and statisticians some key concepts being discussed include experimental design randomization ab testing causal inference counterfactuals strategies for managing data quality bias and confounding contrasting machine versus classical statistical inference promo httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvbiymwwnbi cover image by jonathan gross creative commons bynd httpsflickrpqvudb

introduction the perfect data science
this is one intended to be taken in one please do the roughly in the order presented each lecture has reading and except for the introductory lecture every lecture has a question quiz get out of or better on the quiz
just for fun promotional data science in the ideal versus real life part data science in the ideal versus real life part examples machine vs traditional statistics part machine vs traditional statistics part managing the data pull experimental design and observational analysis causality part causality part what can go wrong confounding ab testing sampling bias and random sampling blocking and adjustment multiplicity effect size significance modeling comparison with benchmark effects negative controls nonsignificance estimation target is relevant report writing version control

managing data analysis
this oneweek describes the process of analyzing data and how to manage that process we describe the iterative nature of data analysis and the role of stating a sharp question exploratory data analysis inference formal statistical modeling interpretation and communication in addition we will describe how to direct analytic activities within a team and to drive the data analysis process towards coherent and useful results this is a focused designed to rapidly get you up to speed on the process of data analysis and how it can be managed our goal was to make this as convenient as possible for you without sacrificing any essential content weve left the technical information aside so that you can focus on managing your team and moving it forward after completing this know how to describe the basic data analysis iteration identify different types of questions and translate them to specific datasets describe different types of data pulls explore datasets to determine if data are appropriate for a given question direct model building efforts in common data analyses interpret the results from common data analyses integrate statistical findings to form coherent data analysis presentations commitment of study hours cover image by fdecomite creative commons by httpsflickrphjmvd
