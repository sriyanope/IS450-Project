when and how to use surveys
discussion prompt
introduction the basics of ux research ethics and ux research survey terms understanding error four sources of error

asking the right people coverage error

defining your population probability vs nonprobability nonprobability samples nonprobability samples panels survey modes

getting answers nonresponse error

nonresponse the respondent mindset nonresponse increasing benefits nonresponse reducing cost nonresponse establishing trust

writing questions measurement error

evaluating designs with users
when designing systems that for users there is no substitute for watching them try to use the system to see what works and what doesnt
ux how to design and conduct tests with users that will tell you how effective your design is for helping users do what they need to do and how they feel about using your system this is part of the user ux research and design offered on coursera what identify different approaches to user testing and their appropriate use understand how to design an effective user test understand how to run an effective user test to get the most information possible out of each encounter analyze and report on user testing

what is user testing

understanding user needs
designing effective interactive systems requires understanding the needs and capabilities of the people who will be using them ux focus on how to interact with users or potential users to understand what they need what they currently do what they love and hate and examine human capabilities and behavior as they relate to ux design
learners will be introduced to numerous techniques to gather data from and about users this is part of the user ux research and design offered on coursera what find out what user needs assessments are what qualitative research is and how the two are related an endtoend methodology for qualitative research that is suited for understanding user needs the methodology includes knowledge of semistructured interviews insitu observation and affinity walls be exposed to good practices for conducting semistructured interviews insitu observation and affinity walls gain some with semistructured interviews insitu observations and affinity walls

ux design from concept to prototype
great design doesnt come out of nowhere
it is born nurtured and grownall through a systematic learnable process ux explore the process of taking a basic concept grounded in user needs and developing it into a design that will address those needs in the gain handson with techniques such as sketching scenario development storyboarding and wireframing that will help you transform your understanding of what your users need into a compelling user then how to turn wireframes and interaction architecture into interactive prototypes that can be tested with prospective users and iteratively refined into a high quality design that that is ready for a handoff to the development team for implementation
what define and scope the design problem try to address create user stories and storyboards to transform information about user needs into design concepts produce sketches and conduct brainstorming sessions to generate many design ideas from which you can construct a highquality design solution develop interface wireframes to concretize the design and enable early user testing conduct user tests with paper prototypes to get preliminary user feedback on the design concept and interactions develop highfidelity mockups that specify visual design elements create wizard of oz prototypes to efficiently test complex interactions and interactive systems that are not screenbased eg smart assistants

introduction to the design process
be introduced to the nature of design the design process and methods of formative research you are expected to spend to hours on this workload by the end of this understand the user design process and how to conduct formative research
lesson what is design lesson design process an lesson framing design problems lesson formative research

ideation
this will cover one of the practical topics ideation brainstorm and sketch possible solutions to your design problem also share your sketches with your fellow learners hear their thoughts about your designs and provide feedback on their by the end of this gain an understanding of various methods of ideation as as the structure developed by haakon faste and eric paulos for brainstorming
lesson introduction to ideation lesson sketching lesson brainstorming

design constraints and making choices
this will introduce the other practical topics creation of early design representations like scenarios personas and storyboards that illuminate findings about user needs discovered through your formative research by the end of this how designers move from formative research to a design solution how the questions options criteria framework can help us make design decisions and gain handson in creating personas scenarios and storyboards
lesson personas lesson scenarios lesson storyboards lesson design rationale

building blocks of user interaction
start with understanding the conceptual underpinnings of user interactions by introducing the basic building blocks of user interaction in addition to lectures quizzes and discussions this involves actual design planning out the kinds of information the system you are designing will need to take in and the kinds of feedback it will need to provide to users by the end of this be able to define the elements of user interaction and types of data input also be able to design effective inputs and outputs to enable users to complete tasks successfully as as conceptualize design problems by using the building blocks of user interaction
lesson lesson introduction lesson elements of user interaction data input lesson elements of user interaction output state and mode lesson introduction to prototyping

low to hifidelity prototyping
will provide an of different forms of prototyping your design for this will be wireframing the main screens of your application by the end of this be able to identify the characteristics and applications of lowfidelity and hifidelity prototypes and apply the most effective prototype for answering a particular design question also how to test design concepts and functionality by utilizing wireframes and create lowfidelity and hifidelity prototypes to assess and improve your design
lesson wireframes lesson lowfidelity interactive prototypes lesson testing lofi prototypes lesson adding realism to prototypes

conceptual issues in prototyping and design
this introduces some of the issues that designers need to think about when prototyping such as defaults and mental models create a functional lowfidelity prototype of your design by the end of this understand the affordances and limitations of interface formats to evaluate how the default features of a design impact the user identify potential consequences of usage beyond a designs intentions and describe the gulfs of execution and evaluation
lesson key design concepts lesson defaults lesson reflective design lesson new directions in ux design wrapup
