devops cloud and agile foundations
devops is more than just a fusion of development and operations it is the cultural change that organizations everywhere are adopting to become more agile and innovate at scale it makes it easier to deliver software and services at the speed the market demands
this will equip you with a foundational understanding of devops cloud computing agile and scrum and their transformational impact on businesses and approaches to software engineering
about the devops culture and its benefits cloud computing fundamentals the agile philosophy and scrum methodology familiarize yourself with the technology tools processes practices and metrics to become a successful devops practitioner
this is suitable for both technical audiences who want to either upskill with devops or start a indemand domain to become devops engineers software engineers application developers sres cloud specialists etc as less technical audiences including managers executives product managers and project managers

the projects in these courses do not involve any coding and are designed for you to apply and demonstrate your grounding in devops and its principles

introduction to agile development and scrum
get started with using agile development and scrum with this selfpaced introductory after successfully completing this be able to embrace the agile concepts of adaptive planning iterative development and continuous improvement resulting in early deliveries and value to customers
look at scrum as a framework and how to apply it alongside agile also become familiar with related methodologies like waterfall extreme programming xp and kanban apply agile practices derived from lean manufacturing concepts like testdriven development how a scrum team functions also about the importance of agile iterative planning and enable yourself to write good user stories and track your teams progress using a kanban board create and refine a product backlog collaboratively with the team and the customer in a flexible and blameless culture also how to use burndown charts achieve sprint goals and conduct the sprint review and retrospective this approach will lead you to higher levels of efficiency with the ability to plan and execute sprints with your development team measuring success with actionable metrics this is about more than facts and processes it is about working collaboratively on a selforganizing team coached by a scrum master and building what is needed rather than simply following a plan developed and taught by an experienced agile practitioner the includes handson practice through realistic scenariobased labs using github and zenhub the will benefit anyone who wants to get started with working the agile way or transform the organizational culture to adopt and realize the benefits of scrum this includes project managers product managers and executives it is particularly suitable for it practitioners such as software developers development managers and it scrum masters
