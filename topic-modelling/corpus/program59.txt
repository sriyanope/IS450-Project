introduction to the biology of cancer
over people in the united states and over million people worldwide are dying every year from cancer as people live longer the incidence of cancer is rising worldwide and the disease is expected to strike over million people annually by this open is designed for people who would like to develop an understanding of cancer and how it is prevented diagnosed and treatedthe introduces the molecular biology of cancer oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes as well as the biologic hallmarks of cancer the also describes the risk factors for the major cancers worldwide including lung cancer breast cancer colon cancer prostate cancer liver cancer and stomach cancer we explain how cancer is staged the major ways cancer is found by imaging and how the major cancers are treated in addition to the core materials this includes two honors lessons devoted to cancers of the liver and prostate upon successful completion of this be able to identify the major types of cancer worldwide lecture describe how genes contribute to the risk and growth of cancer lecture list and describe the ten cellular hallmarks of cancer lecture define metastasis and identify the major steps in the metastatic process lecture describe the role of imaging in the screening diagnosis staging and treatments of cancer lecture explain how cancer is treated lecture we hope that this gives you a basic understanding of cancer biology and treatment the is not designed for patients seeking treatment guidance but it can help you understand how cancer develops and provides a framework for understanding cancer diagnosis and treatment

incidence and etiology of cancer
first well get a highlevel introduction to the basics of cancer biology as well as incidence and common types of cancer
welcome to the incidence and etiology overview incidence and etiology of cancer cancer incidence the common cancers

genetics of cancer
now well turn our attention to the genetics of cancer variation and mutation twohit hypothesis and genomic instability
genetics overview basic introduction to genetics genetic variation and mutation twohit hypothesis and genomic instability

ten cellular hallmarks of cancer
all cancers share ten cellular hallmarks to identify these hallmarks in order to distinguish a normal cell from a cancerous cell
cellular hallmarks overview the human cell and hallmarks of cancer the human cell and cellular hallmarks cancer cellular hallmarks of cancer preparing the cancer cell to move and metastasize

metastasis the real killer
the lethal agent of cancer is metastasis well take a good look at this deadly event tnm staging the metastatic process and an ecological paradigm
metastasis overview introduction to metastasis tnm staging the metastatic process an ecological paradigm why do cancer cells metastasize from the primary tumor

imaging in oncology
well examine imaging as a tool for diagnosis staging and treatment of cancer
imaging overview introduction to imaging types of imaging imaging in clinical oncology theory of oligometastasis and how treatment is supported by imaging

treatment
final well examine the variety of treatment options available to doctors and patients as well as the features of clinical trials and how they are used to improve the treatment arsenal
treatment overview types of treatment types of treatments for individual cancers clinical trials wrapup liver cancer overview incidence risk factors screening staging for liver cancer treatment of liver cancer

understanding cancer metastasis
over people in the united states and over million people worldwide are dying from cancer every year as people live longer the incidence of cancer is rising worldwide and the disease is expected to strike over million people annually by everyone has been or will be touched by cancer in some way during their lifetime thanks to years of dedication and commitment to research weve made enormous advances in the prevention and treatment of cancer but there is still a lot of to be done physicians and scientists at the johns hopkins school of medicine explain how cancer spreads or metastasizes well describe the major theories of metastasis and then describe the biology behind the steps in metastasis the also describes the major organs targeted by metastasis and describes how metastases harm the patient

history and overview of metastasis
first well concentrate on the history and overview of metastasis and give you a flavor of how cancer is defined as well as some of the history surrounding how we began to understand metastasis
introduction to understanding cancer metastasis introduction to history and overview of metastasis history and overview of metastasis history of metastasis theory introduction to the sequential steps of metastasis

primary tumor growth and neoangiogenesis
well focus on uncontrolled cell division which is a defining property of cancer as well as mutation and neoangiogenesis and their roles in tumor formation well also take a look at a primary tumor microenvironment and its component cell types
introduction to primary tumor growth and neoangiogenesis tumor formation uncontrolled cell division the role of mutations in primary tumor formation and evolution neoangiogenesis new blood vessel formation in cancer the primary tumor microenvironment what else affects primary tumor growth

emt invasion intravasation
during this well turn our attention to the next steps after the initial primary tumor formation epithelial to mesenchymal transition of cancer cells and local tumor invasion and intravasation into blood or lymph vessels
