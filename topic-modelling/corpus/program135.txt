mastering data analysis in excel
important the focus of this is on math specifically dataanalysis concepts and methods not on excel for its own sake we use excel to do our calculations and all math formulas are given as excel spreadsheets but we do not attempt to cover excel macros visual basic pivot tables or other intermediatetoadvanced excel functionality
this will prepare you to design and implement realistic predictive models based on data in the final project assume the role of a business data analyst for a bank and develop two different predictive models to determine which applicants for credit cards should be accepted and which rejected your first model will focus on minimizing default risk and your second on maximizing bank profits the two models should demonstrate to you in a practical handson way the idea that your choice of business metric drives your choice of an optimal model the second big idea this seeks to demonstrate is that your dataanalysis results cannot and should not aim to eliminate all uncertainty your role as a dataanalyst is to reduce uncertainty for decisionmakers by a financially valuable increment while quantifying how much uncertainty remains to calculate and apply to realworld examples the most important uncertainty measures used in business including classification error rates entropy of information and confidence intervals for linear regression all the data you need is provided within the all are designed to be done in ms excel and enough excel to complete all the will give you enough practice with excel to become fluent in its most commonly used business functions and be ready to any other excel functionality you might need in the future the does not cover visual basic or pivot tables and not need them to complete the all advanced concepts are demonstrated in individual excel spreadsheet templates that you can use to answer relevant questions emerge with substantial vocabulary and practical knowledge of how to apply business data analysis methods based on binary classification information theory and entropy measures and linear regression and all using no software tools more complex than excel

about this introduction to mastering data analysis in excel

excel essentials for beginners
will explore the essential excel to address typical business situations you may encounter in the future the excel vocabulary and functions taught throughout this make it possible for you to understand the additional explanatory excel spreadsheets that accompany later
introduction to using excel basic excel vocabulary intro to charting arithmetic in excel functions on individual cells functions on a set of numbers functions on ordered pairs of data sorting data in excel introduction to the solver plugin

binary classification
separating collections into two categories such as buy this stock dont but that stock or target this customer with a special offer but not that one is the ultimate goal of most business dataanalysis projects there is a specialized vocabulary of measures for comparing and optimizing the performance of the algorithms used to classify collections into two groups how and why to apply these different metrics including how to calculate the allimportant auc the area under the receiver operating characteristic roc curve
introduction to binary classification bombers and seagulls confusion matrix costs determine optimal threshold calculating positive and negative predictive values how to calculate the area under the roc curve binary classification with more than one input variable

information measures
how to calculate and apply the vitally useful uncertainty metric known as entropy in contrast to the more familiar probability that represents the uncertainty that a single will occur entropy quantifies the aggregate uncertainty of all possible the entropy measure provides the framework for accountability in dataanalytic entropy gives you the power to quantify the uncertainty of future relevant to your business twice using the bestavailable estimates before you begin a project and then again after you have built a predictive model the difference between the two measures is the information gain contributed by your
quantifying the informational edge probability and entropy entropy of a guessing game dependence and mutual information the monty hall problem learning from one coin toss part learning from one coin toss part

linear regression
the linear correlation measure is a much richer metric for evaluating associations than is commonly realized you can use it to quantify how much a linear model reduces uncertainty when used to forecast future it can be converted into a point estimate plus a confidence interval or converted into an information gain measure develop a fluent knowledge of these concepts and the many valuable uses to which linear regression is put in business data analysis this also teaches how to use the central limit theorem clt to solve practical problems the two topics are closely related because regression and the clt both make use of a special family of probability distributions called gaussians everything you need to know to with gaussians in these and other contexts
introducing the gaussian introduction to standardization standard normal probability distribution in excel calculating probabilities from zscores central limit theorem algebra with gaussians markowitz portfolio optimization standardizing x and y coordinates for linear regression standardization simplifies linear regression modeling error in linear regression information gain from linear regression

additional for model building
this gives you additional valuable concepts and related to building highquality models as you know a model is a of a process applied to available data inputs that produces an estimate of a future and as yet unknown as output very often models for outputs take the form of a probability distribution this covers how to estimate probability distributions from data a probability histogram and how to describe and generate the most useful probability distributions used by data scientists it also covers in detail how to develop a binary classification model with parameters optimized to maximize the auc and how to apply linear regression models when your input consists of multiple types of data for each event the concludes with an explanation of overfitting which is the main reason that apparently good predictive models often fail in real life business settings we conclude with some tips for how you can avoid overfitting in you own predictive model for the final project and in real life
describing histograms and probability distributions functions some important and frequently encountered pdfs linear regression with more than one input variable understanding why overfitting happens

final project
the final project is a comprehensive assessment covering all of the material and consists of four quizzes and a peer review for quiz one and quiz two there are learning points that explain components of the quiz these learning points will unlock only after you complete the quiz with a passing grade before you start please read through the final project instructions from past student the final project which includes all the quizzes and peer assessment takes anywhere from hours
