spring framework
this explains high level patterns used in microservice architectures and the motivation to move towards these architectures and away from monolithic development of applications students will how java interacts with databases in a modern framework using the very popular spring boot framework with microservices students wishing to develop java based web applications and restful micro services will be using the very popular spring mvc and spring boot frameworks with minimal configuration

students will build an extensive application iteratively in a succession of hands on labs labs will specifically target the projects eureka ribbon hystrix feign and zuul this is a very hands on series with a variety of labs to illustrate the key concepts

spring ecosystem and core
students will the why the spring framework is one of the dominant java development frameworks the covers a variety of techniques for java object dependency injection using various forms of configuration data ie xml annotations and java configuration classes with factory methods configurations will be enhanced with expression languages and conditional beans that are available based off certain conditions like development environment ie test and production students will build an extensive application iteratively in a succession of hands on labs

what is spring
identify the motivation for the spring framework in enterprise application development implement a spring inversion of control container and use dependency injection techniques using xml metadata configurations
spring introduction what is spring dependency injection the motivation to use spring the applicationcontext lab solution walkthrough setter injection constructor injection lab solution walkthrough

annotations and java config
achieve spring applicationcontext configuration using spring and javax annotations and java configuration classes
annotations spring annotations javax annotations lab solution walkthrough java configuration in spring lab solution walkthrough lab solution walkthrough junit

externalize configuration
utilize expressions in spring configurations by either expression language for literal injection or spring expression language spel for a more dynamic installation provide conditionals for selective inclusion of beans in a configuration
el and spel lab solution walkthrough conditional beans lab solution walkthrough lab solution walkthrough

spring cloud
this explains some high level patterns used in microservice architectures and the motivation to move towards these architectures and away from monolithic development of applications it then goes on to implement these patterns using spring cloud netflix oss one of the most popular cloud implementations of microservices used today students will about service registration service discovery client side load balancing circuit breakers and gateway or edge services in a spring boot setting it will leverage spring cloud and netflix oss labs will specifically target the projects eureka ribbon hystrix feign and zuul

spring cloud
take a look at the motivation for microservice architectures the major service patterns involved and the meaning of service discovery and orchestration
introduction microservices spring clound lab setup service registries eureka and service registration lab walkthrough lab walkthrough

service discovery circuit breakers and clients
implement service registration with service registries use load balanced service discovery techniques and implement different types of client services
service discovery client side load balancing lab walkthrough lab walkthrough hystrix feign zuul lab walkthrough

spring data repositories
this is aimed at students wishing to how java interacts with databases in a modern framework the uses the very popular spring boot framework with micro services as a setting for our database interactions using java persistence framework jpa and spring data repositories to abstract away jpa students will then how to expose repositories as rest web services in their own right using hypermedia as the engine of application state or hateaos concepts spring aspect oriented programming aop will be covered to illustrate how cross cutting concerns like logging can be applied in a centralized non evasive manner to domain classes finally the covers the use of spring transaction managers and springs declarative configuration transaction model

spring data repositories
incorporate java persistence architecture jpa into spring applications abstract away the details of jpa through the spring data project utilizing jpa repositories
introduction spring and jpa entitymanagers lab setup lab walkthrough lab walkthrough lab walkthrough jpa repositories spring data rest lab walkthrough rest and jpa relationships lab walkthrough projections lab walkthrough lab walkthrough lab walkthrough

spring aop and transactions
decorate spring managed beans with non evasive additional functionalities through spring aspect oriented programming for cross cutting concerns such as logging and transaction management use springs declarative transaction management annotations for transaction propagation and rollback
aop lab walkthrough joinpoint and around advice lab walkthrough transactions transaction propagation lab walkthrough

spring mvc spring boot and rest controllers
this is a aimed at students wishing to develop java based web applications and restful micro services using the very popular spring mvc and spring boot frameworks with minimal configuration the student will develop services through various url templates consume and respond with json or xml payloads and create custom http headers requestors of these services will include java and angular js clients to illustrate the reuse capabilities of services in a distributed architecture traditional web applications will also be covered that render web pages in a typical model view controller mvc architecture this is a very hands on with a series of labs to illustrate the key concepts

spring mvc springboot and restcontrollers
understand the spring model view controller mvc architecture how spring boot abstracts the complexities of this architecture away through opinionated defaults subsequently implement quickly rest services that can take advantage of the spring framework dependency injection framework and built in http payload message converters
introduction spring mvc spring boot project lab walkthrough rest controllers lab walkthrough customizations lab walkthrough lab walkthrough configuration property classes lab walkthrough bean definitions in the application class

request parameters
provide request parameters to spring restcontrollers and understand the key concept of content negotiation implement services that provide json or xml responses and services that receive json or xml payloads write java clients for services that use the spring resttemplate or use angular js to access your services
using request parameters lab walkthrough lab walkthrough posting lab walkthrough resttemplate lab walkthrough content negotiation content negotiation resttemplate lab walkthrough lab walkthrough

controllers
implement a spring controller that will dispatch to a view html page rather than a service response in json or xml
controllers and viewresolvers lab walkthrough
