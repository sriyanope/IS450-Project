data visualization dashboarding with r
this is intended for learners seeking to develop the ability to visualize data using r through five courses use r to create static and interactive data visualizations and publish them on the web which will you prepare you to provide insight to many types of audiences

learners will generate many different types of visualizations to explore data from simple figures like bar plots and scatter plots to interactive dashboards learners will integrate these figures into reproducible research products and share them online

data visualization capstone
data visualization is a critical for anyone that routinely using quantitative data in his or her which is to say that data visualization is a tool that almost every worker needs today one of the critical tools for data visualization today is the r statistical programming language especially in conjunction with the tidyverse software packages r has become an extremely powerful and flexible platform for making figures tables and reproducible reports however r can be intimidating for first time users and there are so many resources online that it can be difficult to sort through without guidance
this is the final in the data visualization and dashboarding in r learners will enter with a welldeveloped set of making a wide variety of visualizations in r the focus on this will applying those to a unique project drawing on publicly available data to tell a compelling story using the data visualization toolkit assembled in the previous courses

publishing visualizations in r with shiny and flexdashboard
data visualization is a critical for anyone that routinely using quantitative data in his or her which is to say that data visualization is a tool that almost every worker needs today one of the critical tools for data visualization today is the r statistical programming language especially in conjunction with the tidyverse software packages r has become an extremely powerful and flexible platform for making figures tables and reproducible reports however r can be intimidating for first time users and there are so many resources online that it can be difficult to sort through without guidance
this is the fourth in the data visualization and dashboarding in r learners will come to this with a strong background in making visualization in r using ggplot to build on those this covers creating interactive visualization using shiny as as combining different kinds of figures made in r into interactive dashboards

advanced data visualization with r
data visualization is a critical for anyone that routinely using quantitative data in his or her which is to say that data visualization is a tool that almost every worker needs today one of the critical tools for data visualization today is the r statistical programming language especially in conjunction with the tidyverse software packages r has become an extremely powerful and flexible platform for making figures tables and reproducible reports however r can be intimidating for first time users and there are so many resources online that it can be difficult to sort through without guidance
this is the third in the data visualization and dashboarding in r learners come into this with a foundation using r to make many basic kinds of visualization primarily with the ggplot package accordingly this focuses on expanding the learners inventory of data visualization options drawing on additional packages to supplement ggplot learners will made more variants of traditional figures as as venture into spatial data the ends make interactive and animated figures to fill that need this is intended for learners who have little or no with r but who are looking for an introduction to this tool by the end of this students will be able to import data into r manipulate that data using tools from the popular tidyverse package and make simple reports using r markdown the is designed for students with good basic computing but limited if any with programming
