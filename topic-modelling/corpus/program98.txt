data visualization dashboarding with r
this is intended for learners seeking to develop the ability to visualize data using r through five courses use r to create static and interactive data visualizations and publish them on the web which will you prepare you to provide insight to many types of audiencesapplied projectlearners will generate many different types of visualizations to explore data from simple figures like bar plots and scatter plots to interactive dashboards learners will integrate these figures into reproducible research products and share them online

data visualization capstone
data visualization is a critical for anyone that routinely using quantitative data in his or her which is to say that data visualization is a tool that almost every worker needs today one of the critical tools for data visualization today is the r statistical programming language especially in conjunction with the tidyverse software packages r has become an extremely powerful and flexible platform for making figures tables and reproducible reports however r can be intimidating for first time users and there are so many resources online that it can be difficult to sort through without guidancethis is the final in the data visualization and dashboarding in r learners will enter with a welldeveloped set of making a wide variety of visualizations in r the focus on this will applying those to a unique drawing on publicly available data to tell a compelling story using the data visualization toolkit assembled in the previous courses

developing your eye and finding data
we will review the requirements for the capstone and some possible souces for data then we have a very fast overview of resources on good data visualization practice
welcome to the and overview overview and tips for locating data data import data viz pointers anscombes quartet and datasaurus more best practices and overview

cleaning your data
we will review the requirements for the second component of your capstone where demonstrate that your data is ready for visualization then we reintroduce some important tools for cleaning data in r
overview strings lubridate factors joins and pivots

making your report
do one more visualization critique and the rest of your time in the should be devoted to finishing your capstone

publishing visualizations in r with shiny and flexdashboard
data visualization is a critical for anyone that routinely using quantitative data in his or her which is to say that data visualization is a tool that almost every worker needs today one of the critical tools for data visualization today is the r statistical programming language especially in conjunction with the tidyverse software packages r has become an extremely powerful and flexible platform for making figures tables and reproducible reports however r can be intimidating for first time users and there are so many resources online that it can be difficult to sort through without guidancethis is the fourth in the data visualization and dashboarding in r learners will come to this with a strong background in making visualization in r using ggplot to build on those this covers creating interactive visualization using shiny as well as combining different kinds of figures made in r into interactive dashboards

introduction to shiny
we will get started using shiny to create interactive visualizations you should begin by watching the introductory in each lesson then carefully review the and reference materials provided once you have done that i recommend watching the again to check your understanding take a few quizzes as you progress through the material to make sure you are keeping up
introduction getting started with shiny example of a custom shiny app building your own shiny app uploading apps to shinyappsio integrating shiny into r markdown reports

customizing shiny apps
we will go into greater details about laying shiny applications you should begin by watching the introductory in each lesson then carefully review the and reference materials provided once you have done that i recommend watching the again to check your understanding take a few quizzes as you progress through the material to make sure you are keeping up
input and output with shiny layouts in shiny

flexdashboard
we will how to use flexdashboard to display visualization in a dashboard format you should begin by watching the introductory in each lesson then carefully review the and reference materials provided once you have done that i recommend watching the again to check your understanding take a few quizzes as you progress through the material to make sure you are keeping up

advanced data visualization with r
data visualization is a critical for anyone that routinely using quantitative data in his or her which is to say that data visualization is a tool that almost every worker needs today one of the critical tools for data visualization today is the r statistical programming language especially in conjunction with the tidyverse software packages r has become an extremely powerful and flexible platform for making figures tables and reproducible reports however r can be intimidating for first time users and there are so many resources online that it can be difficult to sort through without guidancethis is the third in the data visualization and dashboarding in r learners come into this with a foundation using r to make many basic kinds of visualization primarily with the ggplot package accordingly this focuses on expanding the learners inventory of data visualization options drawing on additional packages to supplement ggplot learners will made more variants of traditional figures as well as venture into spatial data the ends make interactive and animated figures to fill that need this is intended for learners who have little or no with r but who are looking for an introduction to this tool by the end of this students will be able to import data into r manipulate that data using tools from the popular tidyverse package and make simple reports using r markdown the is designed for students with good basic computing but limited if any with programming

advanced figures with ggplot
we will through making a number of different figures using ggplot and a few additional r packages you should begin by watching the introductory in each lesson then carefully review the and reference materials provided once you have done that i recommend watching the again to check your understanding take a few quizzes as you progress through the material to make sure you are keeping up
