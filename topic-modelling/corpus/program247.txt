machine and reinforcement in finance
the main goal of this is to provide the knowledge and practical necessary to develop a strong foundation on core paradigms and algorithms of machine ml with a particular focus on applications of ml to various practical problems in finance the aims at helping students to be able to solve practical mlamenable problems that they may encounter in real life that include mapping the problem on a general landscape of available ml methods choosing particular ml approaches that would be most appropriate for resolving the problem and successfully implementing a solution and assessing its performance the is designed for three categories of students practitioners working at financial institutions such as banks asset management firms or hedge funds individuals interested in applications of ml for personal day trading current fulltime students pursuing a degree in finance statistics computer science mathematics physics engineering or other related disciplines who want to about practical applications of ml in financethe can also be taken individually to improve relevant in a particular area of applications of ml to financeapplied projectthe is essentially in ml where all examples home and deal with various problems in finance such as stock trading asset management and banking applications and the choice of topics is respectively driven by a focus on ml methods that are used by practitioners in finance the is meant to prepare the students to on complex machine in finance that often require both a broad understanding of the whole field of ml and understanding of appropriateness of different methods available in a particular subfield of ml for example unsupervised for addressing practical problems they might encounter in their

reinforcement in finance
this aims at introducing the fundamental concepts of reinforcement rl and develop use cases for applications of rl for option valuation trading and asset management by the end of this students will be able to use reinforcement to solve classical problems of finance such as portfolio optimization optimal trading and option pricing and risk management practice on valuable examples such as famous qlearning using financial problems apply their knowledge acquired in the to a simple model for market dynamics that is obtained using reinforcement as the prerequisites are the courses guided tour of machine in finance and fundamentals of machine in finance students are expected to know the lognormal process and how it can be simulated knowledge of option pricing is not assumed but desirable
