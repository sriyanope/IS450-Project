machine learning and reinforcement learning in finance
the main goal of this is to provide the knowledge and practical necessary to develop a strong foundation on core paradigms and algorithms of machine learning ml with a particular focus on applications of ml to various practical problems in finance
the aims at helping students to be able to solve practical mlamenable problems that they may encounter in real life that include
mapping the problem on a general landscape of available ml methods
choosing particular ml approaches that would be most appropriate for resolving the problem and
successfully implementing a solution and assessing its performance
the is designed for three categories of students
practitioners working at financial institutions such as banks asset management firms or hedge funds
individuals interested in applications of ml for personal day trading
current fulltime students pursuing a degree in finance statistics computer science mathematics physics engineering or other related disciplines who want to about practical applications of ml in finance
the can also be taken individually to improve relevant in a particular area of applications of ml to finance

the is essentially in ml where all examples home and projects deal with various problems in finance such as stock trading asset management and banking applications and the choice of topics is respectively driven by a focus on ml methods that are used by practitioners in finance the is meant to prepare the students to on complex machine learning projects in finance that often require both a broad understanding of the whole field of ml and understanding of appropriateness of different methods available in a particular subfield of ml for example unsupervised learning for addressing practical problems they might encounter in their

reinforcement learning in finance
this aims at introducing the fundamental concepts of reinforcement learning rl and develop use cases for applications of rl for option valuation trading and asset management
by the end of this students will be able to use reinforcement learning to solve classical problems of finance such as portfolio optimization optimal trading and option pricing and risk management practice on valuable examples such as famous qlearning using financial problems apply their knowledge acquired in the to a simple model for market dynamics that is obtained using reinforcement learning as the project prerequisites are the courses guided tour of machine learning in finance and fundamentals of machine learning in finance students are expected to know the lognormal process and how it can be simulated knowledge of option pricing is not assumed but desirable

guided tour of machine learning in finance
this aims at providing an introductory and broad of the field of ml with the focus on applications on finance supervised machine learning methods are used in the capstone project to predict bank closures simultaneously while this can be taken as a separate it serves as a preview of topics that are covered in more details in subsequent of the machine learning and reinforcement learning in finance
the goal of guided tour of machine learning in finance is to get a sense of what machine learning is what it is for and in how many different financial problems it can be applied to the is designed for three categories of students practitioners working at financial institutions such as banks asset management firms or hedge funds individuals interested in applications of ml for personal day trading current fulltime students pursuing a degree in finance statistics computer science mathematics physics engineering or other related disciplines who want to about practical applications of ml in finance with python including numpy pandas and ipythonjupyter notebooks linear algebra basic probability theory and basic calculus is necessary to complete
