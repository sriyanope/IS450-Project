fitting statistical models to data with python
expand our exploration of statistical inference techniques by focusing on the science and art of fitting statistical models to data build on the concepts presented in the statistical inference to emphasize the importance of connecting research questions to our data analysis methods also focus on various modeling objectives including making inference about relationships between variables and generating predictions for future observations
this will introduce and explore various statistical modeling techniques including linear regression logistic regression generalized linear models hierarchical and mixed effects or multilevel models and bayesian inference techniques all techniques will be illustrated using a variety of real data sets and the will emphasize different modeling approaches for different types of data sets depending on the study design underlying the data referring back to understanding and visualizing data with python during these labbased sessions learners will through tutorials focusing on specific case studies to help solidify the weeks statistical concepts which will include further deep dives into python libraries including statsmodels pandas and seaborn this utilizes the jupyter notebook environment within coursera

<DOC>considerations for statistical modeling
we begin this third of the statistics with python with an of what is meant by fitting statistical models to data first introduce key model fitting concepts including the distinction between dependent and independent variables how to account for study designs when fitting models assessing the quality of model fit exploring how different types of variables are handled in statistical modeling and clearly defining the objectives of fitting models

<DOC>fitting models to independent data
second introduce you to the basics of two types of regression linear regression and logistic regression get the chance to think about how to fit models how to assess how those models fit and to consider how to interpret those models in the context of the data also how to implement those models within python
linear regression introduction linear regression inference interview causation vs correlation logistic regression introduction logistic regression inference
</DOC>

<DOC>fitting models to dependent data
in the third of this be building upon the modeling concepts discussed in multilevel and marginal models will be our main topic of discussion as these models enable researchers to account for dependencies in variables of interest introduced by study designs be covering why and when we fit these alternative models likelihood ratio tests as as fixed effects and their interpretations
what are multilevel models and why do we fit them multilevel linear regression models multilevel logistic regression models practice with multilevel modeling the cal poly app what are marginal models and why do we fit them marginal linear regression models marginal logistic regression
</DOC>

<DOC>special topics
final we introduce special topics that extend the curriculum from previous weeks and courses further cover a broad range of topics such as various types of dependent variables exploring sampling methods and whether or not to use survey weights when fitting models and indepth case studies utilizing bayesian techniques to derive insights from data also have the to apply bayesian techniques in python
should we use survey weights when fitting models introduction to bayesian bayesian approaches to statistics and modeling bayesian approaches case study part i bayesian approaches case study part ii bayesian approaches case study part iii

understanding and visualizing data with python
learners will be introduced to the field of statistics including where data come from study design data management and exploring and visualizing data learners will identify different types of data and how to visualize analyze and interpret summaries for both univariate and multivariate data learners will also be introduced to the differences between probability and nonprobability sampling from larger populations the idea of how sample estimates vary and how inferences can be made about larger populations based on probability sampling
at the end of each learners will apply the statistical concepts theyve learned using python within the environment during these labbased sessions learners will discover the different uses of python as a tool including the numpy pandas statsmodels matplotlib and seaborn libraries tutorial are provided to walk learners through the creation of visualizations and data management all within python this utilizes the jupyter notebook environment within coursera
</DOC>
<DOC>introduction to data
in the first of the review a outline and discover the various concepts and objectives to be mastered in the weeks to come get an introduction to the field of statistics and explore a variety of perspectives the field has to offer identify numerous types of data that exist and observe where they can be found in everyday life delve into basic python functionality along with an introduction to jupyter notebook all of the information on grading prerequisites and expectations are on the syllabus and you can find more information on our resources page
welcome to the understanding and visualizing data guidelines what is statistics interview perspectives on statistics in real life cool stuff in data where do data come from variable types study design optional introduction to jupyter notebooks optional data types in python optional introduction to libraries and data management
</DOC>

<DOC>univariate data
in the second of this be looking at graphical and numerical interpretations for one variable univariate data in particular be creating and analyzing histograms box plots and numerical summaries of our data in order to give a basis of analysis for quantitative data and bar charts and pie charts for categorical data a few key interpretations will be made about our numerical summaries such as mean iqr and standard deviation an assessment is included at the end of the concerning numerical summaries and interpretations of these summaries
categorical data tables bar charts pie charts quantitative data histograms quantitative data numerical summaries standard score empirical rule quantitative data boxplots demo interactive histogram boxplot
</DOC>

<DOC>multivariate data
in the third of this on looking at data introduce key ideas for examining research questions that require looking at more than one variable in particular consider both numerically and visually how different variables interact how summaries can appear deceiving if you dont properly account for interactions and differences between quantitative and categorical variables this weeks will consist of a writing along with reviewing those of your peers
looking at associations with multivariate categorical data looking at associations with multivariate quantitative data demo interactive scatterplot introduction to pizza

<DOC>populations and samples
spend more time thinking about where data come from the highestquality statistical analyses of data will always incorporate information about the process used to generate the data or features of the data collection design be exposed to important concepts related to sampling from larger populations including probability and nonprobability sampling and how we can make inferences about larger populations based on welldesigned samples also about the concept of a sampling distribution and how estimation of the variance of that distribution plays a critical role in making statements about populations finally about the importance of reading the documentation for a given data set a key step in looking at data is also looking at the available documentation for that data set which describes how the data were generated
