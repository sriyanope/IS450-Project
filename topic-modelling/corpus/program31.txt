artificial intelligence an overview
this is intended for beginners seeking to enter the artificial intelligence world through five courses cover artificial intelligence technical groundings including machine and technologies ethical and legal issues which will give you a clear picture of what artificial intelligence is and what artificial intelligence will provide in the next futureapplied projectno specific handson is required but through this composed by introductory courses learners will have all the necessary concept and tools to start building their own combining the tools and concepts seen in the courses

artificial intelligence and legal issues
the purpose of the is to help students understand the legal implications related to the design and use of artificial intelligence systems providing an overview of the risks and legal protections that can be envisaged and giving an overview of the legislation and legal principles currently applicable on the subject in particular the profiles of civil and criminal liability protection in terms of intellectual property and the impacts of ai on the fundamental rights of the individual including privacy and the right to nondiscrimination will be examined

artificial intelligence law and legal issues


artificial intelligence and liability

civil liability and compensation for damages the existing legal framework on civil liability liability on the production and use of the intelligent systems criminal liability

artificial intelligence and intellectual property

the protection of intelligent systems in the light of copyright ai and patentability the protection of works created by ai

artificial intelligence and risks to fundamental rights

the protection of privacy the risks of algocracy for the fundamental freedoms from cambridge analytica to mass surveillance ai compliant to the legal privacy framework
