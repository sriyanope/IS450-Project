ui ux design
the uiux design brings a designcentric approach to user interface and user design and offers practical skillbased instruction centered around a visual communications perspective rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone sequence of four courses summarize and demonstrate all stages of the uiux development process from user research to defining a projects strategy scope and information architecture to developing sitemaps and wireframes current best practices and conventions in ux design and apply them to create effective and compelling screenbased for websites or apps
user interface and user design is a highdemand field but the and knowledge are applicable to a wide variety of careers from marketing to web design to humancomputer interaction
learners enrolled in the uiux design are eligible for an extended free trial month of a full product suite of ux tools from optimal workshopopens in a new tab details are available in of the web design strategy and information architecture

participate in several short exercisesboth visual and nonvisualto apply acquired knowledge from organizing and structuring screenbased content defining goals and strategy to creating wireframes and visual mockups by the end of this have produced a midlevel digital prototype with simulated functionality as as a comprehensive plan for a complex website

visual elements of user interface design
this designcentric examines the broad question of what an interface is and what role a designer plays in creating a user interface learning how to design and articulate meaning using color type and imagery is essential to making interfaces function clearly and seamlessly through a series of lectures and visual exercises focus on the many individual elements and components that make up the skillset of an interface designer by the end of this be able to describe the key formal elements of clear consistent and intuitive ui design and apply your learned to the design of a static screenbased interface
this is the first in the uiux design which brings a designcentric approach to user interface ui and user ux design and offers practical skillbased instruction centered around a visual communications perspective rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone these courses are ideal for anyone with some in graphic or visual design and who would like to build their set in ui or ux for app and web design it would also be ideal for anyone with in front or backend web development or humancomputer interaction and want to sharpen their visual design and analysis for ui or ux

<DOC>what is a user interface anyway
first look at some basic broad concepts and contexts for user interfaces looking at examples both on and offscreen look at basic principles of interaction theory discuss the relationship between ui and ux and examine the relationship between coding and designing discuss the roles of functionality and aesthetics in interface design and outline a formfirst philosophy to user interface design will focus on background information and terminology and will give you the context and vocabulary necessary before you start making great interfaces
introduction to what is a user interface the relationship between ui and ux roles in uiux a brief historical of interface design interface conventions theory interface conventions application template vs content aesthetics functionality
</DOC>

<DOC>formal elements of interface design
we are going to examine the various formal elements that make up an interface start out with the larger questions of content context and audience that frame any uiux project in other words what is it who is it for and where does it live and look at the big picture of overall design direction what is often referred to as look and feel from there go into detail of how the basic components of how visual design works in the context of interface design language shape color imagery typography and icons these areas will be the formal building blocks use to create the more complex visual structure of a screenbased user interface
introduction to design before design look and feel language as a design tool color and shape imagery typography icons
</DOC>

<DOC>active elements of interface design
we are going to take our static interface elements and begin to think about how a user interacts with them in other words how to bring these elements a stage closer to having a life on the screen be looking at navigational conventions such as menus buttons and icons in different states our focus will move from what the graphic interface looks like to include how it works and how it responds to the user by adding interactivity to our static designs the idea is to think more deeply about the role the designer plays in shaping a users interactive
introduction to static to active functionality speed and style composition and structure buttons not buttons states and changes
</DOC>

<DOC>composing the elements of interface design
we are going to take our individual interface components and see what happens when we try to put them together into a more complex structure be looking at how to get our components to harmoniously as a family figuring out how hierarchy works in the interface and discussing conventions and expectations of contemporary interface design also be examining how to navigate to different screens and how to build visual relationships between different kinds of content within a single site finally be discussing different platforms how to create variable content for different screen sizes and looking at how to organize complex bodies of content into userfriendly structures

ux design fundamentals
this handson examines how content is organized and structured to create an for a user and what role the designer plays in creating and shaping user be led through a condensed process that acts as a roadmap for developing robust uiux design from ideation and sitemapping to the creation of paper and digital prototypes building on the design learned in visual elements of user interface design apply this methodology to produce a digital prototype for a multiscreen app of your own invention
by the end of this be able to describe and apply current best practices and conventions in ux design and employ the fundamental principles of how ux design functions to shape an audiences of a given body of content this is the second in the uiux design which brings a designcentric approach to user interface ui and user ux design and offers practical skillbased instruction centered around a visual communications perspective rather than on one focused on marketing or programming alone these courses are ideal for anyone with some in graphic or visual design and who would like to build their set in ui or ux for app and web design it would also be ideal for anyone with in front or backend web development or humancomputer interaction and want to sharpen their visual design and analysis for ui or ux

<DOC>planning testing researching mapping
were going to continue to develop plan and test your app idea start by sketching out more extensive content and mapping it into a structure to test what aspects of your app are working look at how to create a nonvisual paper prototype and our way towards a sitemap while youre developing the logic of your app also begin to develop the look and feel of it the visual development process
introduction to mapping testing envisioning mapping content mapping interaction nonvisual paper prototyping nonvisual user testing sitemap look and feelvisual research
</DOC>

<DOC>what goes where
at this stage in our process we are going to take our site map look and feel research and user testing to the next level in order to get a more accurate static prototype by building a wireframe of our interface figure out what goes where and on which pages utilizing our user testing information to figure out the hierarchy and structure of our app is about the logic and functionality of our interface and how its actually going to within the app
