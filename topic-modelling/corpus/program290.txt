patient safety
preventable patient harms including medical errors and healthcareassociated complications are a global public health threat moreover patients frequently do not receive treatments and interventions known to improve their these shortcomings typically result not from individual clinicians mistakes but from systemic problems communication breakdowns poor teamwork and poorly designed care processes to name a fewthe patient safety quality leadership covers the concepts and methodologies used in process improvement within healthcare successful participants will develop a systems view of safety and quality challenges and will strategies for improving culture enhancing teamwork managing change and measuring success they will also lead all aspects of a patient safety andor quality improvement applying the methods described over the seven courses in the applied projectlearners will use realworld strategies tools and techniques to resolve various patient safety and quality issues based on authentic scenarios that occur in medical and clinical settings they will also be required to leverage crossdisciplinary concepts to successfully address patient safety concerns
