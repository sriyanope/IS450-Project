developing applications with google cloud
you the fundamentals of application development on google cloud through a combination of presentations and handson labs participants best practices for designing cloud applications the use of service orchestration and choreography to coordinate microservices and how to use cloud functions to develop singlepurpose functions that process events within your cloud infrastructure
this class is intended for application developers architects and cloud engineers who want to build new cloud applications or redesign existing applications to run on google cloud
this teaches participants the following
understand how to choose the appropriate data storage option for application use cases
use authentication and authorization to secure an application
describe use cases for the different google cloud compute options for running applications
describe the benefits and challenges of microservicebased architectures
describe the advantages of eventdriven applications
identify the strengths of orchestration and choreography
use workflows eventarc cloud tasks and cloud scheduler to coordinate a microservices application on google cloud
recognize the benefits of and use cases for cloud functions in modern application development
understand how to build test and deploy cloud functions
secure and connect cloud functions to resources and cloud databases
use best practices with cloud functions

this incorporates handson labs using our qwiklabs platform
these hands on components will let you apply the you in the lectures projects will incorporate topics such as google cloud products which are used and configured within qwiklabs you can expect to gain practical handson with the concepts explained throughout the
