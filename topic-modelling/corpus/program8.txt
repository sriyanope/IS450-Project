migrating to the aws cloud
this introductory is for anyone who wants a deeper dive into aws migration whether you want to understand what services are helpful need to plan a migration for your organization or are helping other groups with their own migration find valuable information throughout this the sessions structure cloud migration through the threephase migration process from aws assess mobilize and migrate and modernize this process is designed to help your organization approach and implement a migration of tens hundreds or thousands of applications by learning about this threephase structureand the various aws tools features and services that can help you during each phaseyou will complete this with a better understanding of how to design and implement migrations to aws
</DOC>
<DOC>
of this introduces the concept of migration and some background material and we also discuss the format that the rest of the will follow you about why migration is an important topic different migration types and the threephase migration structure you also about some tools that can help you with more about migrations and how to plan them such as aws prescriptive guidance
purpose of this what is migration why migrate migrations early considerations students for the migration intro and demo of aws prescriptive guidance
</DOC>

<DOC>
dives into the assess phase of the migration structure focuses on understanding and evaluating your current infrastructure tools such as aws migration evaluator and aws migration hub are crucial to this step of your migration and discussions with your organization about your business needs for migrating are also critical additionally you should take the time to about how your utilization in your onpremises environment translates to aws services and tools
what is assessing migration evaluator deep dive and demo tools to help migration hub deep dive translating into aws services part translating into aws services part assessing review additional assessment considerations
