matlab programming for engineers and scientists
this aims to take learners with little to no programming to being able to create matlab programs that solve realworld problems in engineering and the sciences the focus is on computer programming in general but the numerous language features that make matlab uniquely suited to engineering and scientific computing are also covered in depth topics presented range from basic programming concepts in the first through more advanced techniques including recursion efficiency object oriented programming graphical user interfaces in the second to data and image analysis data visualization and machine learning in the third

the includes two projects the first one is the final project of the second it is about creating an object oriented application with a graphical user interface that visualizes covid related data from around the world the second project is part of the third and it focuses on image processing

introduction to programming with matlab
this teaches computer programming to those with little to no previous it uses the programming system and language called matlab to do so because it is easy to versatile and very useful for engineers and other professionals matlab is a specialpurpose language that is an excellent choice for writing moderatesize programs that solve problems involving the manipulation of numbers the design of the language makes it possible to write a powerful in a few lines the problems may be relatively complex while the matlab programs that solve them are relatively simple relative that is to the equivalent written in a generalpurpose language such as c or java as a result matlab is being used in a wide variety of domains from the natural sciences through all disciplines of engineering to finance and beyond and it is heavily used in industry hence a solid background in matlab is an indispensable in todays job market
nevertheless this is not a matlab tutorial it is an introductory programming that uses matlab to illustrate general concepts in computer science and programming students who successfully complete this will become familiar with general concepts in computer science gain an understanding of the general concepts of programming and obtain a solid foundation in the use of matlab students taking the will get a matlab online license free of charge for the duration of the the students are encouraged to consult the ebook that this is based on more information about these resources can be found on the resources menu on the right

<DOC>matrices and operators
the basic unit with which we in matlab is the matrix we solve problems by manipulating matrices and operators are the primary means by which we manipulate them how to define matrices extract parts of them and combine them to form new matrices how to use operators to add subtract multiply and divide matrices and that there are several different types of multiplication and division finally matlabs rules for determining the order in which operators are carried out when more than one of them appear in the same expression
introduction to matrices and operators the colon operator accessing parts of a matrix combining and transforming matrices arithmetic part arithmetic part

<DOC>functions
functions let us break up complex problems into smaller more manageable parts how functions let us create reusable software components that can be applied in many different programs how the environment inside a function is separated from the outside via a defined interface through which it communicates with that outside world how to define a function to allow input to it when it initiates its execution and output from it when it is done
introduction to functions function io formal definition of functions subfunctions scope advantages of functions scripts

<DOC>programmers toolbox
matlab has useful builtin functions and explore many of them section about polymorphism and how matlab exploits it to change a functions behavior on the basis of the number and type of its inputs because random numbers play an important role in computer programming how to use the matlab random number generator how to get input from the keyboard how to print to the command window and how to plot graphs in a figure window finally how to find programming errors with the help of the debugger
introduction to programmers toolbox matrix building input output plotting debugging

<DOC>selection
selection is the means by which matlab makes decisions about the order in which it executes its statements how to use the ifstatement which is the most important method of selection how to use relational operators and logical operators how to write polymorphic functions and how to make functions resistant to error
selection ifstatements continued relational and logical operators nested ifstatements variable number of function arguments robustness persistent variables
</DOC>

<DOC>loops
loops give computers their power how to use both of matlabs loop constructs the forloop and the whileloop how the breakstatement works and use nested loops how to make loops more efficient about logical indexing and will see how to use it to produce implicit loops that are efficient and easy for a user to understand
forloops whileloops break statements logical indexing preallocation
</DOC>

<DOC>data types
computers operate on bits but humans think in terms of numbers words and other types of data like any good language matlab organizes bits into convenient data types study those types section that there are ten types of numbers and that there are conversion functions to change one type into another much more about strings and how the characters in them are encoded as numbers how to produce heterogeneous collections of data via structs and cells and how to store points in time and time durations
introduction to data types character arrays structs cells the string type introduced in a the datetime and duration types introduced in b

<DOC>file inputoutput
files are named areas in permanent memory for storing data that can be used as input or output to matlab and to other programs be introduced to matlabs most important methods for reading and writing files how to create read from and write into matfiles excel files text files and binary files how to navigate among folders with matlab commands
file inputoutput excel files text files binary files

mastering programming with matlab
the builds on the foundation laid by the first of the called introduction to programming with matlab it covers more advanced programming concepts such as recursion vectorization function handles algorithm efficiency and others at the same time it presents many features that make matlab a powerful programming environment for engineering and scientific computing such as its support for object oriented programming the new user interface design environment and live scripts
by the end of this be familiar with more advanced computer programming concepts able to write more efficient code and able to create object oriented matlab applications with graphical user interfaces
