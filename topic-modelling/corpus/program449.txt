getting started with sas programming
this is for users who want to how to write sas programs to access explore prepare and analyze data it is the entry point to sas programming for data science machine and artificial intelligence it is a prerequisite to many other sas coursesby the end of this know how to use sas studio to write and submit sas programs that access sas microsoft excel and text data know how to explore and validate data prepare data by subsetting rows and computing new columns analyze and report on data export data and results to other formats use sql in sas to query and join tables prerequisites learners should have using computer software specifically you should be able to understand file structures and system commands on your operating systems and access data files on your operating systems no prior sas is needed

overview and data setup
you about the and you set up the data you need to do the practices in the
welcome to the demo programming in sas practicing

essentials
you how to use sas programming tools and the fundamentals of sas structure and syntax
overview sas programming interfaces demo programming with sas studio sas structure sas syntax demo understanding sas syntax demo finding and resolving syntax errors

accessing data
you to identify the features of a sas table access data through sas libraries and import data into sas
overview types of data what is a sas table required column attributes for sas tables listing table and column attributes accessing data in a using a library to read sas data automatic sas libraries demo exploring automatic sas libraries using a library to read other file types demo using a library to read excel files importing unstructured data demo importing a commadelimited csv file importing an excel file

exploring and validating data
you to use sas procedures that provide insights about your data you also to subset data so you can focus on particular segments format data so you can easily understand it and sort data to identify and resolve duplicate values
overview exploring data with procedures demo exploring data with sas procedures filtering rows with the where statement combining expressions in a where statement demo filtering rows with basic operators using special where operators creating and using macro variables demo filtering rows using macro variables formatting data values in results common formats for numeric values common formats for date values demo formatting data values in results sorting data identifying and removing duplicates demo identifying and removing duplicate values

preparing data
you how to do some common data manipulations such as filtering rows and columns computing new columns and performing conditional processing
overview using the data step to create a sas data set data step processing demo working with the data step demo using expressions to create new columns using numeric functions to create columns demo using character functions demo using date functions demo conditional processing with ifthen conditional processing with ifthenelse creating character columns with the length statement processing multiple statements with ifthendo demo processing multiple statements with ifthendo

analyzing and reporting on data
we concentrate on summarizing data by using the sas procedures that we touched on for data exploration you also how to use titles column labels footnotes and macro variables to enhance your reports and make them more meaningful
overview using titles and footnotes using macro variables and functions in titles and footnotes applying temporary labels to columns segmenting reports demo enhancing reports applying permanent labels to columns demo creating frequency reports and graphs demo creating twoway frequency reports demo creating a statistics report creating an output table
