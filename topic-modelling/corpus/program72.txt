object tracking and motion detection with computer vision
in the third and final of the computer vision for engineering and science to track objects and detect motion in tracking objects and detecting motion are difficult tasks but are required for applications as varied as microbiology and autonomous systems to track objects you first need to detect them use pretrained deep neural networks to perform object detection also use optical flow to detect motion and use the results to detect moving objects
at the end of this apply all the learned to a final project take the role of an engineer being asked to track cars on a busy highway with the added challenge of counting each vehicle and its direction use matlab throughout this matlab is the goto choice for millions of people working in engineering and science and provides the capabilities you need to accomplish your computer vision tasks be provided free access to matlab for the duration to complete your to be successful it will help to have some prior image processing if you are new to image data its recommended to first complete the image processing for engineering and science

introduction to computer vision
in the first of the computer vision for engineering and science be introduced to computer vision and use the most common algorithms for feature detection extraction and matching to align satellite images and stitch images together to create a single image of a larger scene
features are used in applications like motion estimation object tracking and machine learning use features to estimate geometric transformations between images and perform image registration registration is important whenever you need to compare images of the same scene taken at different times or combine images acquired from different scientific instruments as is common with hyperspectral and medical images use matlab throughout this matlab is the goto choice for millions of people working in engineering and science and provides the capabilities you need to accomplish your computer vision tasks be provided free access to matlab for the duration to complete your to be successful it will help to have some prior image processing if you are new to image data its recommended to first complete the image processing for engineering and science
