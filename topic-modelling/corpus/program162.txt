fundamentals of immunology
this is designed to equip students with the basic concepts and vocabulary of immunology the goal is to provide students from different backgrounds with a fundamental understanding of immunology and the ability to appreciate and analyze new developments in immunological therapies designed for the treatment of disease

in the fundamentals of immunology the basics of innate immunity including complement and its role in inflammation and activation of adaptive immunity
the development of b cells and the production and improvement of antibodies
the development of th cells and their roles in promoting both immune responses and tolerance
the role of the major histocompatibility proteins in alerting t cells and their role in the success of organ and tissue transplants
the mechanisms whereby cytotoxic t cells and natural kill cells recognize rogueself cells and prod them into apoptosis
the principles of chemical communication among immune cells
some example of how the immune system can cause problems and how we deal with these issues

fundamentals of immunology dueling with pathogens and cancer
four fundamentals of immunology dueling with pathogens and cancer covers the constant battle between your immune system and threats to your health the first two lectures discuss viral and cellular pathogens focusing on specific tactics they use to deflect immune attacks next a cheerier lecture describes other immunebased therapies beginning with engineered antibodies to treat specific diseases this lecture continues with vaccine development viralengineered killed rnacomponent vaccines and more and adjuvant function and ends with vaccination strategies including herd immunity and resisting the antivaccination movement the last two lectures cover immune deficiencies and how cancer evades the immune system concluding with advances in using immune therapies antibodies and car t cells to cure cancer

fundamentals of immunology innate immunity and bcell function
of a four called fundamentals of immunology innate immunity and bcell function each in the presents material that builds on the previous courses material
this is the first leg of a fourpart journey through the defenses your body uses to keep you healthy part we hope to give you the vocabulary and concepts you need to interact with the medical community and provide them with a context that makes them memorable fundamentals of immunology innate immunity and bcell function introduces students to the basic functions of the adaptive and innate immune systems the early lectures survey cells tissues and organs using metaphors cartoons and models to improve understanding and retention after describing the form function origin and varieties of antibodies subsequent lectures provide details on the mechanism of the generation of variation the provides animations of gene rearrangement and class switching and descriptions of affinity maturation correlated with detailed physical models of antibody structure the final lecture reviews these concepts in an anatomical context testing employs multiple choice questions testing facts concepts and application of principles questions may refer to diagrams drawings and photographs used in the lecture and reproduced in the outline what the difference between adaptive and innate immune systems the characteristics of various pathogens that they protect you from and the overall strategies employed protection the detailed structure of antibodies and related immunoglobulin receptors the characteristics and function of the different antibody classes and the mechanism for producing both the recognition regions and stem regions finally how these structures are coded for in the dna and expressed in the b cells
