biostatistics in public health
this is intended for public health and healthcare professionals researchers data analysts social workers and others who need a comprehensive conceptscentric biostatistics primer those who complete the will be able to read and respond to the scientific literature including the methods and results sections in public health medicine biological science and related fields successful learners will also be prepared to participate as part of a research team

in each learners will assume the role of a biostatistical consultant helping research teams review and interpret the published scientific literature throughout the specializations learners will return to two important studies one on asthma medication and another on injectable contraception to answer the researchers questions about the published statistical methods and results

project
during this you get the chance to demonstrate what youve learned by putting yourself in the shoes of biostatistical consultant on two different studies one about selfadministration of injectable contraception and one about medical appointment scheduling in brazil the two research teams have asked you to help them interpret previously published results in order to inform the planning of their own studies if youve already taken other courses then this scenario will be familiar

two involves several lectures a practice quiz and a graded quiz topics include statistics visual displays role of sample size and continuous data
introduction useful statistics visual displays the role of sample size on sample based estimates comparing distributions of continuous data additional examples

the normal distribution
the focus of this is on normal distribution topics covered include defining the standard normal distribution and application of principles of normal distribution to sample data there is a practice quiz where you can test your knowledge before completing the graded quiz
introduction the standard normal distribution defined applying the principles of the normal distribution to sample data to estimate characteristics of population data what happens when we apply the properties of the normal distribution to data not approximately normal a warning additional examples

binary data
four covers binary data and its significance in addition to lectures complete a practice quiz and a graded quiz
introduction binary data definition and summarization binomial distribution phat sd comparing distributions of binary data risk difference and relative risk comparing distributions of binary data odds ratios a brief note about ratios will also be revisited later in the additional examples

dealing with the element of time
in five explore how time is defined and studied in relation to data and about the kaplanmeir curve in addition to a practice quiz complete a graded quiz and project
introduction time to event data definition censoring and numerical measures incidence rates numerically comparing groups on time to event summarizing timetoevent data graphically graphically comparing groups on time to event additional examples

project
during this you get the chance to demonstrate what youve learned by putting yourself in the shoes of biostatistical consultant on two different studies one about asthma medication and the other about selfadministration of injectable contraception the two research teams have asked you to help them interpret previously published results in order to inform the planning of their own studies

simple regression analysis in public health
biostatistics is the application of statistical reasoning to the life sciences and its the key to unlocking the data gathered by researchers and the evidence presented in the scientific public health literature focus on the use of simple regression methods to determine the relationship between an of interest and a single predictor via a linear equation along the way be introduced to a variety of methods and practice interpreting data and performing calculations on real data from published studies topics include logistic regression confidence intervals pvalues cox regression confounding adjustment and effect modification

simple regression methods
one covers simple regression the four different types of regression commonalities between them and simple linear aggression before completing the graded quiz you can test your knowledge with the practice quiz
introduction simple regression an simple linear regression with a binary or nominal categorical predictor simple linear regression with a categorical predictor simple linear regression with a continuous predictor simple linear regression model estimating the regression equationaccounting for uncertainty in the estimates measuring the strength of a linear association additional examples

simple logistic regression
within two look at logistic regression create confidence intervals and estimate pvalues have the to test your knowledge in both a practice quiz and a graded quiz
