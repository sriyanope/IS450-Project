what is data science
do you want to know why data science has been labeled the sexiest profession of the st century after taking this be able to answer this question understand what data science is and what data scientists do and about paths in the field the art of uncovering insights and trends in data has been around since ancient times the ancient egyptians used census data to increase efficiency in tax collection and accurately predicted the nile rivers flooding every year since then people have continued to use data to derive insights and predict recently they have carved out a unique and distinct field for the they do this field is data science in todays world we use data science to find patterns in data and make meaningful datadriven conclusions and predictions this is for everyone and teaches concepts like how data scientists use machine and deep and how companies apply data science in business meet several data scientists who will share their insights and in data science by taking this introductory begin your journey into this thriving field

defining data science and what data scientists do
in you delve into some fundamentals of data science in lesson you listen to how other professionals in the field define what data science is to them and the paths they took to consider data science as a for themselves you explore different roles data scientists fulfill how data analysis is used in data science and how data scientists follow certain processes to answer questions with that data moving on to lesson the focus shifts to the daily activities of data scientists this encompasses about various realworld data science problems that professionals solve the and qualities needed to be a successful data scientist and opinions on how big data relates to those you also a little about various data formats data scientists with and algorithms used in the field to process data
introduction what is data science fundamentals of data science the many paths to data science advice for new data scientists lesson defining data science a day in the life of a data scientist data science big data understanding different types of file formats data science topics and algorithms lesson what do data scientists do

data science topics
in the first lesson you gain insight into the impact of big data on various aspects of society from business operations to sports and develop an understanding of key attributes and challenges associated with big data about the big data fundamentals how data scientists use the cloud to handle big data and the data mining process lesson two delves into machine and deep and the relationship of artificial intelligence to data science
how big data is driving digital transformation introduction to cloud cloud for data science foundations of big data data science and big data what is hadoop big data processing tools hadoop hdfs hive and spark lesson big data and data mining artificial intelligence and data science generative ai and data science neural networks and deep applications of machine lesson deep and machine

applications and careers in data science
in the first lesson you about the power of data science applications and how organizations leverage this power to drive business goals improve efficiency make predictions and even save lives you also reviewed the process follow as a data scientist to help your organization accomplish these ends in the second lesson you investigate what companies seek in a competent experienced data scientist how to position yourself to get hired as a data scientist amidst the diverse backgrounds from which data scientists emerge you identify the qualities they share and that consistently set them apart from other datarelated roles complete a peerreviewed final by looking at a job posting for data scientist and identifying commonalities between the job and what you learned also walk through a case study where you about sarah and her data science journey
how should companies get started in data science old problems new data science solutions applications of data science how data science is saving lives lesson data science applications domain how can someone become a data scientist recruiting for data science careers in data science importance of mathematics and statistics for data science lesson careers and recruiting in data science

data literacy for data science optional
this optional focuses on understanding data and data literacy and is intended to supplement what you learned in the first three as a data scientist need to understand the ecosystem in which your data lives and how it gets manipulated to analyze it this introduces you to some of these fundamentals in lesson one you explore how data can be generated stored and accessed in lesson two you take a deeper dive into data repositories and processes for handling massive data sets
understanding data data sources viewpoints working with varied data sources and types lesson understanding data data collection and organization relational database management system nosql data marts data lakes etl and data pipelines viewpoints considerations for choice of data repository data integration platforms lesson welcome to data literacy
