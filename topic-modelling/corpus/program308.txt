psychological research
this is primarily aimed at first and secondyear undergraduates interested in psychology data analysis ethics in research and quantitative research methods along with high school students and professionals with similar interests
learners will develop knowledge about the fundamentals of research design for quantitative studies in psychology analysis of data from quantitative studies in psychology and ethical standards for conducting psychological research learning activities focus on applications of this knowledge to realword scenarios and on critical thinking about problems faced by researchers in the past

over the duration of the the user will be presented with formative assessments to assess their knowledge on concepts that have just been covered at the end of every there are summative assessments which are tracked and graded to assess your overall understanding finally at the end of the you are presented with an overall level assessment

introduction to statistics for psychological research
this will begin by introducing the basic concepts of how to describe and visualize data the fundamentals of using statistics to make inferences and the logic of null hypothesis testing various types of hypothesis tests will be introduced along with criteria for selecting which is appropriate for different study conditions as an extension of null hypothesis significance tests about how to interpret effect sizes and confidence intervals along with statistical power before being introduced to alternatives to null hypothesis significance testing
welcome data analysis for the behavioral sciences

data analysis basics
first section of the the fundamental concept of the variable is introduced and explained along with some of the basic statistical methods we use to describe and summarize variables in data sets
the heart of statistics making distinctions levels of measurement roles variables play summarizing data describing data with univariate frequency distributions measures of central tendency variability describing data with bivariate graphs correlation and causation

null hypothesis significance testing
we move on from descriptive statistics like the mean and standard deviation into inferential statistics which help us use sample data to draw inferences about the populations the samples represent
probability normal distributions parametric tests john arbuthnots null hypothesis the logic of null hypothesis significance testing an illustration of nhst in action the results of the null hypothesis significance testing process selecting a statistical test nonparametric alternatives

beyond null hypothesis significance testing
section of the we consider the role of null hypothesis significance testing in psychological research some objections that have been raised to that approach and some alternative approaches that have been proposed
what are p values effect size confidence intervals more complete reporting of results statistical power determining statistical power bayesian inference estimation methods metaanalysis modeling

conclusion
review the main ideas from the previous organized by learning objectives los

introduction to methods for quantitative research in psychology


scientific psychology
as the backbone of all science the scientific method is a systematic approach to generating new knowledge by collecting data to answer a research question
eight steps the scientific literature asking research questions

variables and measurement
data are the currency of science each data point a recording of a measurement on some scale each point representing one value of a variable that uses that scale this explains how psychologists define and use variables and how we measure the values of those variables when we collect data
recognizing variables measuring variables measurement error

research designs
different research questions and variables call for different research designs this describes the four basic research designs how they and the kinds of data they yield
exploring research designs using descriptive research methods using correlational research methods using experimental research methods using quasiexperimental research methods

interpretation how valid are our conclusions
conclusions in science are always tentativenew evidence may force us to reconsider them or a once validseeming proposition can be rendered invalid on a reconsideration of existing evidence this considers different forms of validity and how they are evaluated
construct validity internal validity external validity
