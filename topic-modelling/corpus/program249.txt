design and build an input data pipeline
data is the a crucial component of a machine model collecting the right data is not enough you also need to make sure you put the right processes in place to clean analyze and transform the data as needed so that the model can take the most signal of it as possible we discuss training on large datasets with tfdata working with inmemory files and how to get the data ready for training then we discuss embeddings and end with an overview of scaling data with tfkeras preprocessing layers

raw data to features
feature engineering is often the longest and most difficult phase of building your ml in the feature engineering process you start with your raw data and use your own domain knowledge to create features that will make your machine algorithms we explore what makes a good feature and how to represent them in your ml model
introduction overview of feature engineering raw data to features good features versus bad features features should be known at predictiontime features should be numeric features should have enough examples bringing human insight representing features

feature engineering
this reviews the differences between machine and statistics and how to perform feature engineering in both bigquery ml and keras well also cover some advanced feature engineering practices
