network analysis in systems biology
this introduces data analysis methods used in systems biology bioinformatics and systems pharmacology research the covers methods to process raw data from genomewide mrna expression studies microarrays and rnaseq including data normalization clustering dimensionality reduction differential expression enrichment analysis and network construction the contains practical tutorials for using several bioinformatics tools and setting up data analysis pipelines also covering the mathematics behind the methods applied by these tools and workflows the is mostly appropriate for beginning graduate students and advanced undergraduates majoring in fields such as biology statistics physics chemistry computer science biomedical and electrical engineering the should be useful for wet and drylab researchers who encounter large datasets in their own research the presents software tools developed by the maayan laboratory httplabsicahnmssmedumaayanlab from the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai in new york city but also other freely available data analysis and visualization tools the overarching goal of the is to enable students to utilize the methods presented for analyzing their own data for their own for those students that do not in the field the introduces research challenges faced in the fields of computational systems biology and systems pharmacology

overview and introductions
the introduction to complex systems discusses complex systems and leads to the idea that a cell can be considered a complex system or a complex agent living in a complex environment just like us the introduction to biology for engineers provides an introduction to some central topics in cell and molecular biology for those who do not have the background in the field this is not a comprehensive coverage of cell and molecular biology the goal is to provide an entry point to motivate those who are interested field coming from other disciplines to begin studying biology

dynamical modeling methods for systems biology
an introduction to dynamical modeling techniques used in contemporary systems biology researchwe take a casebased approach to teach contemporary mathematical modeling techniques the is appropriate for advanced undergraduates and beginning graduate students lectures provide biological background and describe the development of both classical mathematical models and more recent representations of biological processes the will be useful for students who plan to use experimental techniques as their approach in the laboratory and employ computational modeling as a tool to draw deeper understanding of experiments the should also be valuable as an introductory overview for students planning to conduct original research in modeling biological systems this focuses on dynamical modeling techniques used in systems biology research these techniques are based on biological mechanisms and simulations with these models generate predictions that can subsequently be tested experimentally these testable predictions frequently provide novel insight into biological processes the approaches taught here can be grouped into the following categories ordinary differential equationbased models partial differential equationbased models and stochastic models

introduction to systems biology
this will introduce the student to contemporary systems biology focused on mammalian cells their constituents and their functions biology is moving from molecular to modular as our knowledge of our genome and gene expression deepens and we develop lists of molecules proteins lipids ions involved in cellular processes we need to understand how these molecules interact with each other to form that act as discrete functional systems these systems underlie core subcellular processes such as signal transduction transcription motility and electrical excitability in turn these processes come together to exhibit cellular behaviors such as secretion proliferation and action potentials what are the properties of such subcellular and cellular systems what are the mechanisms by which emergent behaviors of systems arise what types of experiments inform systemslevel thinking why do we need computation and simulations to understand these systemsthe will develop multiple lines of reasoning to answer the questions listed above two major reasoning threads are the design execution and interpretation of multivariable experiments that produce large data sets quantitative reasoning models and simulations examples will be discussed to demonstrate how cell level functions arise and why mechanistic knowledge allows us to predict cellular behaviors leading to disease states and drug responses

experimental methods in systems biology
about the technologies underlying experimentation used in systems biology with particular focus on rna sequencing mass specbased proteomics flowmass cytometry and livecell imaginga key driver of the systems biology field is the technology allowing us to delve deeper and wider into how cells respond to experimental perturbations this in turns allows us to build more detailed quantitative models of cellular function which can give important insight into applications ranging from biotechnology to human disease this gives a broad overview of a variety of current experimental techniques used in modern systems biology with focus on obtaining the quantitative data needed for computational modeling purposes in downstream analyses we dive deeply into four technologies in particular mrna sequencing mass spectrometrybased proteomics flowmass cytometry and livecell imaging these techniques are often used in systems biology and range from genomewide coverage to single molecule coverage millions of cells to single cells and single time points to frequently sampled time courses we present not only the theoretical background upon which these technologies but also enter real wet lab environments to provide instruction on how these techniques are performed in practice and how resultant data are analyzed for quality and content
