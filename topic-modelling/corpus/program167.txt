game design and development d platformer
if you love games and want to how to make them then this is your second step down that path the fundamentals of game design including an understanding of the game world storytelling gameplay user and game technology continue developing videogames using industry standard game development tools including the unity game engine at the end of the have completed a d platformer game and will be able to leverage an array of game development techniques to create your own basic games

your second step into game design and development
are you ready to take the next step in your journey into game design and development we will introduce the theory and practice of this from a theoretical perspective we will be using the design play framework across this as a vehicle to discuss game design from a practical standpoint be creating your second game in the a d platformer in the first part of the follow along with the tutorial introduced in the second part of the modify the game to make it your own

game worlds and storytelling in games
we will explore two important parts of the design the game world and storytelling the game world simply put is the world where the game takes place at its simplest level it is defined by space and time but we will explore the game world across the physical temporal environmental emotional and ethical dimensions in addition to the game world we will also explore storytelling in games there are two perspectives on storytelling in games the designers story and the players story the designers story is the storytelling that is designed into the game the designers story can be used to set the stage provide purpose and engagement and convey content among other things the setting character design and narrative are the designers primary design tools the storytelling that occurs during play combines the designers story with the interactions and choices the player makes the resulting crafts the players story

gameplay and user
we will explore the next two layers of the design play framework including gameplay and user the gameplay layer defines what the player does in the game that is what choices the player can make in the game world and what ramifications those choices will have on the rest of the game the gameplay layer is broken down into mechanics dynamics and affects the mechanics are the rules that define the operation of the game world what the player can do the challenges the player will face and the players goals the dynamics are the resulting behavior when the rules are instantiated over time with the influence of the players interactions the resulting or emotions derived in the player are the affects while the user layer is represented as the deepest layer in the framework it is actually the most visible or surface layer from the perspective of the player where it is manifested through the user interface the interface encompasses everything the user sees hears and interacts with and how that interaction happens ie the control system

game technology and finishing up
everything in the design play framework is grounded on the technology that you are building the game upon overall the capabilities and limitations of the technology and the resources required to implement the technology may greatly influence the design and should be considered throughout the design process also finish up the d platformer submit it for peer review and peer review your fellow learners games finish the strong

milestone your game idea
welcome to the game design and development capstone i will give you a little bit of a sense of what to expect over the coming weeks i am going to be honest with you though this is going to be a fair amount of as you have learned making games takes time and effort and the goal of the capstone is to prove that you have the knowledge and attitude to make games so get ready to flex those game design and development muscles that you have developed across the the first thing you need to do is come up with a game idea and then flesh it out into a high concept and pitch

milestone early prototype blueprint and progress report
now you have to start the process of making your game a reality through early prototyping no matter how you do this either as a nondigital prototype or a digital prototype you need to start building and testing some of your core gameplay systems and mechanics along the way it is helpful to further document your design by creating design blueprints the result of this is an early progress report to make sure you are on track
