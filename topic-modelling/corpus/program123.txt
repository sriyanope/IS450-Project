safety in the utility industry
this arms you with basic utility industry safety knowledge be educated about personal protective equipment fire safety hazardous materials and their symbols gain insights to recognize the importance of a safe environment
this is for individuals considering a in the energy field who have a high school diploma at minimum and basic knowledge of mathematics and existing energy sector employees with less than three years of who have not completed similar training and would benefit from a of foundational industry concepts the is a combination of online lectures and discussions this is the third in the energy production distribution safety that explores various facets of the power sector and features a culminating project involving creation of a roadmap to achieve a selfestablished energyrelated goal to more about the check out a at httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvyhqiyiudk

the basics
in the first be talking about safety and its history and see how we can play a role in enhancing it lets face it at the end of the day we all want to live and in environments in which we feel safe an ideal workplace is an environment in which you feel safe and you are able to maximize your productivity
the basics dangers utility workplace culture responsibilities nuclear natural gas

hazards response
general procedures have been written to cover a wide array of workplace situations yet every possible workplace situation has not been addressed therefore it is imperative employees are conscientious about recognizing possible hazards evaluating them and controlling them review electrical and non electrical hazards you may encounter and how you want to handle them
hazards response hazards nonelectrical hazards first aid symptoms first aid treatment

preparing for hazards in the workplace
start by learning how to recognize potential hazards in the workplace then determine what equipment is necessary to stay safe and comply with the laws regulations
preparing for hazards in the workplace personal protective equipment ppe for general industry personal protective equipment ppe for electric utility industry usecase personal protective equipment ppe equipment guidelines

safety administration management

basic electricity
electricity is a term that covers all the phenomena caused either by static electric charge or by the movement of charge current and the electrical and magnetic fields associated with that this looks at nature and effects of electricity basic electrical properties and simple circuits
introduction energy production distribution safety basic electricity concepts basic electrical properties simple circuits ohms law ac current

generation transmission distribution
electrical energy is transmitted and distributed via overhead lines and underground cables operating at different voltage levels it is necessary to mesh networks to ensure dependable supply for consumers even if individual transmission paths fail this focuses on substations transformers generation transmission subtransmission and distribution
generation transmission distribution substations transformers generation transmission subtransmission distribution

system design switching
circuit breakers are complicated electromechanical devices and must be serviced regularly so that on them can be perform safely switches are installed before and after them
system design switching circuit breakers switches doublebusbar switching sequence

renewable energy smart grid technologies
