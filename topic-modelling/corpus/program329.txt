six sigma green belt
this is for you if you are looking to more about the more advanced components of six sigma and lean six sigma are widely sought by employers both nationally and internationally these have been proven to help improve business processes performance and quality assurance
proven principles and tools specific to six sigma and lean
this is a sequential linear designed that covers a more advanced level of content at the green belt level of six sigma and lean yellow belt knowledge is needed before advancing to green belt which is the second offered here on coursera by the usg green belt knowledge is needed before moving to a black belt
the proper sequence of this is
six sigma and the organization advanced
six sigma advanced define and measure phase
six sigma advanced analyze phase
six sigma advanced improve and control phase
at the end of six sigma advanced improve and control phase there is a peerreviewed capstone project successful completion of this project is necessary for full completion of this
it should be noted that completing either the yellow belt or green belt specializations does not give the learner accreditation in six sigma but should assist in better preparation for such accreditation testing

upon completion of this learners will have created a project charter project team charter data collection plan process map control plan along with null and alternative hypotheses problem statement business case goal statement process and scope and timeline all these will be created using the six sigma principles and tools they learned
