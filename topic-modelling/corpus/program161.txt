flight mechanics anemobarometry
this focuses on the physics of the atmosphere and its consequences on speed and altitude measurementsat the end of this understand precisely the meaning of the speed and altitude indication available to the pilot of an airplane understand the difference between standard and actual atmosphere and be able to perform basic altitude and speed correction computations understand why jet airliners need to be pressurized or why a clogged pitot tube can mislead a pilot although some math equations are used from time to time to justify certain results this insists on curve shapes figures tables and you can efficiently follow it while skipping the equationsolving parts if you do not fancy them this is a part of the fundamentals of flight mechanics

atmosphere
this first is dedicated to the atmosphere that surrounds the airplane and allows it to fly and to the basis of flight physics we will focus on the environment in which the airplane evolves the atmosphere we will examine its physics to better understand the effect of altitude on pressure temperature or the speed of sound

flight mechanics the basis
more than one century after the wright brothers first flight the flight still defy our intuition here how to name the different parts of the airplane and how to describe and quantify its geometry for that we need now to share a precise vocabulary to describe the airplanes movement and attitude in space and a refresher on basic general mechanic principles remind how newtons nd law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple or on an airplane to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy discover the very useful concept of total height and be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude while changes in total height are much slower in the end discover that only a very small number of forces apply on an airplane in flight and that be able to classify those that change its energy state and those that modify its trajectory discover the concept of load factor and understand why the pilot of a combat aircraft can feel a weight ninetime greater than his actual weight finally we will establish the lift and propulsion equations that form the basis of flight mechanics and be able to compute the lift and thrust necessary to follow a given trajectory at a given speed this is for anybody interested in more about how planes the physics of flying or flight mechanics it will be of particular interest to undergraduate students in aerospace engineering trainees as well as senior pilots journalists and professionals in the aeronautics sector although some mathematical formalism may be present sometimes it is always doubled by sketches figures and handsexplanations so that anybody can skip the formulas without losing the core understanding of the concepts no apples were harmed in the making of this this is only a foretaste of the mechanics of flight isaesupaero and eric poquillon will offer you other courses and the first in autumn initially three courses will be published to answer several questions can we fly as high as we want what is a stall why do some planes have propellers and others have jet engines is an airplane always stable how do you control an airplane following an engine failure all this and more will be covered series of flight mechanics courses this is a part of the fundamentals of flight mechanics

anatomy of the plane
along this first we want you to get acquainted to the airplane we will first how to name the different parts of the airplane and how to describe and quantify its geometry and we will see through an exercise that concepts that seem well defined like the surface of the wing wing surface can be in practice difficult to measure this part will allow us to share a common and precise vocabulary
airplane components flight controls airplane geometry

vocabulary and tools
we need now to share a precise vocabulary to describe the airplanes movement and attitude in space and a refresher on basic general mechanics principles review how newtons second law allows you to determine what force must be applied on an apple or on an airplane to modify the magnitude and direction of its speed coming back on the concepts of kinetic energy and potential energy discover the very useful concept of total height and be able to explain how an airplane can quickly exchange speed for altitude while changes in total height are much slower to conclude we invite you on a tour of our full flight simulator pegasus pegase in french to see how clever use of those concepts in a headup display might allow you to conduct a perfect approach and landing without a single glance at your speed or altitude indicators

basis of flight mechanics
its time to apply your knowledge to the airplane discover that only a very small number of forces apply on an airplane in flight and that you are able to classify those that change its energy state and those that modify its trajectory discover the concept of load factor and understand why the pilot of a combat aircraft can feel a weight ninetime greater than his actual weight come on board our dr light airplane not a combat airplane indeed with newtons apple to better understand what this load factor actually means finally establish the lift and propulsion equations that form the basis of flight mechanics and be able to compute the lift and thrust necessary to follow a given trajectory at a given speed no apples were harmed in the making of this

flight mechanics lift and trajectory
understand the influence of the angle of attack and speed on the lift then we will focus on hazards and limitations like stall spiral dive or flutteryou will understand why stall phenomenon and mach number limit the maximum lift and altitude the airplane can achieve then you must understand what is flutter and why the altitude and speed of the airplane must be restricted to a safe domain in the end we will explain how to control the trajectory of the airplane and the relation with lift and load factor this is a part of the fundamentals of flight mechanics

lift and angle of attack

controlling the trajectory
as we know how to create lift lets use it now to actually control the trajectory we will first look at how to change our flight direction in the horizontal plane by doing a turn we will then look at the change in the vertical plane when we pull up or push over sometimes alteration of the trajectory is due to external factors like turbulence which may result in unwanted load factor spikes we will determine what we can do to reduce this nuisance
