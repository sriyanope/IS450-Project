expressway to data science python programming
how many times have you decided to a programming language but got stuck somewhere along the way grew frustrated and gave up this is designed for learners who have little or no programming but want to use python as a tool to play with data in the first introduction to python fundamentals the basic input and output methods in python so you can write your first variables operations and flow control statements for more advanced programming in the second introduction to python functions create and use functions to make your programs reusable and adaptive also how to utilize basic packages in the third python packages for data science gain familiarity with the packages specifically used for data science such as pandas numpy matplotlib and seaborn that programming in python is like building with lego you simply follow instructions choose the pieces that fit together and create something fulfilling and unique instead of giving up in frustration discover that python can be easy and funapplied projectlearners will become familiar with python and essential packages for data science through exploratory labs and guided examples starting from one singleline python statement learners will be able to utilize the most widely used python packages to play with data and gain insights from data

introduction to python fundamentals
how many times have you decided to a programming language but got stuck somewhere along the way grew frustrated and gave up this is designed for learners who have little or no programming but want to use python as a tool to play with data the first will introduce you to programming languages with python as an example you are going to how to use variables and operators as well as inputoutput and flow controls to build simple python programs the pace will be very slow so feel comfortable python as quickly or as slowly as you like are you ready lets go logo image courtesy of mourizal zativa available on unsplash here httpsunsplashcomphotosgnmvpapepe

hello python
welcome on board this first will introduce you the basics about computers programming languages and python you are going to basic input and output methods and you are going to write your first interactive python are you ready lets go
overview welcome and introductions python environment hello world quotations python input combine input and print congratulations

variables and operations
this will introduce you the concept variables and primitive data types also the fundamental operations in python arithmetic relational and logical operations with these tools unlocked you can create a more useful computational are you ready lets go
introduction to variables operation types of variables arithmetic operations relational operations boolean data and logical operations congratulations

flow control branching
this will introduce you the concept flow control the branching methods and be able to use optional alternative or nested branching for different conditions are you ready lets go
what is flow control branching and if statements multiple branches decision tree congratulations

flow control repetition
this will introduce you the repetitive flow control methods be able to use conditionbased repetition or countbased repetition for complex programs are you ready lets go
why do we need repetitions conditionbased repetition countbased repetition continue and break congratulations

python packages for data science
how many times have you decided to a programming language but got stuck somewhere along the way grew frustrated and gave up this is designed for learners who have little or no programming but want to use python as a tool to play with data now that you have mastered the fundamentals of python and python functions turn your attention to python packages specifically used for data science such as pandas numpy matplotlib and seaborn are you ready lets go logo image courtesy of mourizal zativa available on unsplash here httpsunsplashcomphotosgnmvpapepe

hello packages
now you have learned the basics of python to be able to play the magic you are going to python packages and their convenience and power you are going to use the packages for something fun are you ready lets go
what are packages lets play with random package exercise game exercise game

data manipulation numpy and pandas
in data science we play with data python has many useful packages for data creation integration and manipulation you are going to numpy and pandas the most widely used two packages for data science are you ready lets go
numpy introduction numpy more numpy more numpy in sum pandas introduction pandas more

data visualization matplotlib
an outstanding data scientist is good at not only data processing and data analyzing but also data visualization and communication you are going to matplotlib one of the most widely used python package to transform your data in a much more interesting taste are you ready lets go
introduction to matplotlib matplotlib plots matplotlib

data visualization seaborn
data visualization can be done by matplotlib and it is not enough seaborn is built upon matplotlib and it provides even more power and convenience to the are you ready lets go
introduction to seaborn more seaborn

introduction to python functions
how many times have you decided to a programming language but got stuck somewhere along the way grew frustrated and gave up this is designed for learners who have little or no programming but want to use python as a tool to play with data in the second introduction to python functions you are going to and use functions predefined in python and python packages you also are able to define functions as well create and use functions to make your programs reusable and adaptive are you ready lets go logo image courtesy of mourizal zativa available on unsplash here httpsunsplashcomphotosgnmvpapepe

hello functions
welcome on board this first shows the reasons why we need functions and introduces basic function definitions you are going to recall some functions we have learned before and you are going to define some simple functions of your own are you ready lets go
overview why do we need functions what are functions lets define functions

functions with parameters
now you should be comfortable with simple functions this introduces you more about functions with parameters which are the majority ones you are going to call when you do your data science are you ready lets go
what are parameters exercise define functions with a single parameter what are multiple parameters exercise define functions with multiple parameters calling functions with keyword arguments

functions with return values
for data science not only we need to execute some functions but also we expect some results from the execution so we can use the results for next step this introduces you the functions with return values are you ready lets go
what are return values exercise define functions with return values

functions in functions
with the knowledge you have learned about simple functions functions with parameters and functions with return values you should be able to nested functions this introduces you the general idea of nested functions as well as two specific categories of them hierarchical functions and recursive functions are you ready lets go
introduction to nested functions exercise define functions calling functions the design of hierarchy of functions recursive functions
