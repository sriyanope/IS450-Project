more with lists strings tuples sets and pycharm
were going to start using pycharm another ide for writing and running python code it has enhanced features that go way beyond the limited functionality of idle and its also an industry standard after revisiting lists including more advanced usage of the commonly used sequence well take a deep dive into two other very important data structures sets and tuples well how they can be leveraged to both store and manipulate information and while we already have some working with strings this will explore the intricacies and more powerful functionality of strings

dictionaries and files
there are multiple ways of loading and storing data in python information can be saved in dictionaries a data structure that is extremely useful for storing multiple attributes or data points about a single thing data can also be stored in external files and then loaded into python this will allow us to with dictionaries in a variety of ways and to interact with the local file system by opening reading from and writing to external files with these added begin to get a better sense of the dynamic power of python and how it can be easily integrated with other systems

unit testing arrays arraylists
be taught to test your code to get it working the best way to do this is to write a set of unit tests that you can run against your at any time well how to do unit testing in java and why we want to do it well also all about java arrays which are collections of items and arraylists which are kind of like arrays but much more flexible these just like lists in python arraylists are part of javas larger collections framework which well continue to reference throughout this

static variables methods polymorphism using overloading
so far weve been defining variables as instance variables in our java classes instance variables are just variables defined inside a class and every instance of a class can have a different value for an instance variable well look at defining static variables in our java classes static variables are also defined as variables inside a class but with the keyword static static variables have the same value for every instance of a class in fact you dont even need to create an instance of a class to use a static variable well also look at static methods and just like static variables you dont need to create an instance of a class to use or call a static method were also going to introduce polymorphism which refers to overloading and overriding well focus on overloading which is having two or more methods in the same class with the same name
introduction instance variables vs static variables creating static variables referencing static variables using static variables for hardcoded values about static methods static helper methods about javas main method when to use a static method other use cases for static other rules for static coding demonstration customer tracking method signatures polymorphism overloading why overload a method dry dont repeat yourself principle of software development legal vs illegal variable and method calls java uses the most specific method multiple constructors coding demonstration dog

this provides a comprehensive look at java inheritance including access modifiers and overriding methods students are introduced to abstract classes and will how to read and write to files use regular expressions for parsing text and how to leverage complex data structures like collections and maps additionally this offers strategies for catching errors and debugging code including an overview of eclipses debugging tool

inheritance polymorphism using overriding access modifiers
well start this by talking about inheritance a core concept in objectoriented programming its the mechanism by which one class inherits the fields and methods of another class then well about another aspect of polymorphism overriding which is creating a method in a subclass having the same signature as a method in a superclass in particular well look at overriding the tostring method for printing your objects and the equals method for comparing your objects especially as it relates to unit testing finally how you can restrict scope in a by using modifiers to control access to variables methods and classes
what to expect from this about the instructor brandon krakowsky how to submit in codio introduction superclasses and subclasses a review of method signatures how to override a method why override a method overriding tostring a review of overriding equals overriding equals for junit tests overriding constructors calling an overridden method why call an overridden method restricting scope public vs protected vs default vs private which access modifier should i use getters setters and encapsulation coding demonstration animals management

abstract classes debugging
did you know you can declare a method without defining it its like giving a method a name and even parameters and a return type with no code in the body these are called abstract methods to define abstract methods well how to create abstract classes with these new concepts and structures well continue to expand our java knowledge and develop our programming well also how to better debug our programs by running them interactively using eclipses debugger this will allow us to watch the source code and the variables during execution

file io exceptions
there are multiple ways of loading and storing data in java information can be stored and manipulated in different kinds of data structures but data can also be stored in external files and then loaded into java well see how java can communicate with the outside world by opening reading from and writing to external files this means of communication known as io or inputoutput is extremely powerful with an overwhelming number of options any given io is not particularly difficult but the difficulty lies in finding your way through the maze of possibilities this will help guide you through some of the different ways you can interact with external files in addition it will demonstrate methods you can use to handle errors and exceptions that may arise in your java programs in particular when youre dealing with files
