ai for medicine
ai is transforming the practice of medicine its helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately make predictions about patients future health and recommend better treatments this threecourse will give you practical in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine
these courses go beyond the foundations of deep learning to teach you the nuances in applying ai to medical use cases if you are new to deep learning or want to get a deeper foundation of how neural networks we recommend taking the deep learning specializationopens in a new tab

medicine is one of the fastestgrowing and important application areas with unique challenges like handling missing data start by learning the nuances of working with d and d medical image data then apply treebased models to improve patient survival estimates also use data from randomized trials to recommend treatments more suited to individual patients finally explore how natural language extraction can more efficiently label medical datasets

ai for medical prognosis
ai is transforming the practice of medicine its helping doctors diagnose patients more accurately make predictions about patients future health and recommend better treatments this will give you practical in applying machine learning to concrete problems in medicine
machine learning is a powerful tool for prognosis a branch of medicine that specializes in predicting the future health of patients second walk through multiple examples of prognostic tasks then use decision trees to model nonlinear relationships which are commonly observed in medical data and apply them to predicting mortality rates more accurately finally how to handle missing data a key realworld challenge these courses go beyond the foundations of deep learning to teach you the nuances in applying ai to medical use cases this focuses on treebased machine learning so a foundation in deep learning is not required for this however a foundation in deep learning is highly recommended for and of this you can gain a foundation in deep learning by taking the deep learning offered by deeplearningai and taught by andrew ng

linear prognostic models
build a linear prognostic model using logistic regression then evaluate the model by calculating the concordance index finally improve the model by adding feature interactions
intro with andrew and pranav prerequisites and learning medical prognosis examples of prognostic tasks atrial fibrillation liver disease mortality risk of heart disease risk score computation evaluating prognostic models concordant pairs risk ties permissible pairs cindex

prognosis with treebased models
tune decision tree and random forest models to predict the risk of a disease evaluate the model performance using the cindex identify missing data and how it may alter the data distribution then use imputation to fill in missing data in order to improve model performance
decision trees for prognosis decision trees dividing the input space building a decision tree how to fix overfitting survival data different distributions missing data example missing completely at random missing at random missing not at random imputation mean imputation regression imputation calculate imputed values

survival models and time
with data where the time that a disease occurs is a variable instead of predicting just the year risk of a disease build more flexible models that can predict the year year or year risk
survival models survival function valid survival functions collecting time data when a stroke is not observed heart attack data right censoring estimating the survival function died immediately or never die somewhere inbetween using censored data chain rule of conditional probability deriving survival calculating probabilities from the data comparing estimates kaplan meier estimate

build a risk model using linear and treebased models
fit a linear model and a treebased risk model on survival data to customize a risk score for each patient based on their health profile the risk score represents the patients relative risk of getting a particular disease then evaluate each models performance by implementing and using a concordance index that incorporates time to event and censored data
