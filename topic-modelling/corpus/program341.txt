statistical analysis with r for public health
statistics are everywhere the probability it will rain today trends over time in unemployment rates the odds that india will win the next cricket world cup in sports like football they started out as a bit of fun but have grown into big business statistical analysis also has a key role in medicine not least in the broad and core discipline of public health
take a peek at what medical research is and how and indeed why you turn a vague notion into a scientifically testable hypothesis about key statistical concepts like sampling uncertainty variation missing values and distributions then get your hands dirty with analysing data sets covering some big public health challenges fruit and vegetable consumption and cancer risk factors for diabetes and predictors of death following heart failure hospitalisation using r one of the most widely used and versatile free software packages around
this consists of four courses statistical thinking linear regression logistic regression and survival analysis and is part of our upcoming global master in public health degree which is due to start in september
the can be taken independently of the gmph and will assume no knowledge of statistics or r software you just need an interest in medical matters and quantitative data

in each be introduced to key concepts and a data set to be used as a worked example throughout that public health data are messy with missing values and weird distributions all too common the data use are either real or simulated from real patientlevel data sets all anonymised and with usage permissions in place
the emphasis will be on learning through doing and learning through discovery as you encounter typical data and analysis problems for you to solve and discuss among your fellow learners get the chance to things out for yourself and with your peers before accessing the answers and explanation provided by the instructors

introduction to statistics data analysis in public health
welcome to introduction to statistics data analysis in public health
this will teach you the core building blocks of statistical analysis types of variables common distributions hypothesis testing but more than that it will enable you to take a data set youve never seen before describe its keys features get to know its strengths and quirks run some vital basic analyses and then formulate and test hypotheses based on means and proportions then have a solid grounding to move on to more sophisticated analysis and take the other courses in the series the popular flexible and completely free software r used by statistics and machine learning practitioners everywhere its handson so first about how to phrase a testable hypothesis via examples of medical research as reported by the media then through a data set on fruit and vegetable eating habits data that are realistically messy because thats what public health data sets are like in reality there will be miniquizzes with feedback along the way to check your understanding the will sharpen your ability to think critically and not take things for granted age of uncontrolled algorithms and fake news these are more important than ever prerequisites some formulae are given to aid understanding but this is not one of those courses where you need a mathematics degree to follow it need only basic numeracy for example not use calculus and familiarity with graphical and tabular ways of presenting results no knowledge of r or programming is assumed

<DOC>introduction to statistics in public health
statistics has played a critical role of in public health research and practice and start by looking at two examples one from eighteenth century london and the other by the united nations the first task in carrying out a research study is to define the research question and express it as a testable hypothesis with examples from the media see what does and does not regard giving you a chance to define a research question from some real news stories

having learned how to define a research question and testable hypothesis earlier in the how to apply hypothesis testing in r and interpret the result as all medical knowledge is derived from a sample of patients random and other kinds of variation mean that what you measure on that sample such as the average body mass index is not necessarily the same as in the population as a whole its essential that you incorporate this uncertainty in your estimate of average bmi when presenting it this involves the calculation of a p value and confidence interval fundamental concepts in statistical analysis see how to do this for averages and proportions

linear regression in r for public health
welcome to linear regression in r for public health
public health has been defined as the art and science of preventing disease prolonging life and promoting health through the organized efforts of society knowing what causes disease and what makes it worse are clearly vital parts of this this requires the development of statistical models that describe how patient and environmental factors affect our chances of getting ill this will show you how to create such models from scratch beginning with introducing you to the concept of correlation and linear regression before walking you through importing and examining your data and then showing you how to fit models using the example of respiratory disease these models will describe how patient and other factors affect such as lung function linear regression is one of a family of regression models and the other courses series will cover two further members regression models have many things in common with each other though the mathematical details differ this will show you how to prepare the data assess how the model fits the data and test its underlying assumptions vital tasks with any type of regression use the free and versatile software package r used by statisticians and data scientists in academia governments and industry worldwide

<DOC>introduction to linear regression
before jumping ahead to run a regression model you need to understand a related concept correlation what it means and how to generate pearsons and spearmans correlation coefficients in r to assess the strength of the association between a risk factor or predictor and the patient then be introduced to linear regression and the concept of model assumptions a key idea underpinning so much of statistical analysis

<DOC>multiple regression and interaction
now see how to extend the linear regression model to include binary and categorical variables as predictors and how to check the correlation between predictors then see how predictors can interact with each other and how to incorporate the necessary interaction terms into the model and interpret them different kinds of interactions exist and can be challenging to interpret so take it slowly with worked examples and to practise

logistic regression in r for public health
welcome to logistic regression in r for public health
why logistic regression for public health rather than just logistic regression there are some particular considerations for every data set and public health data sets have particular features that need special attention in a word theyre messy like the others in the series this is a handson giving you plenty of practice with r on reallife messy data with predicting who has diabetes from a set of patient characteristics as the worked example for this additionally the interpretation of the outputs from the regression model can differ depending on the perspective that you take and public health doesnt just take the perspective of an individual patient but must also consider the population angle that said much of what is covered is true for logistic regression when applied to any data set so be able to apply the principles of this to logistic regression more broadly too by the end of this be able to explain when it is valid to use logistic regression define odds and odds ratios run simple and multiple logistic regression analysis in r and interpret the output evaluate the model assumptions for multiple logistic regression in r describe and compare some common ways to choose a multiple regression model this builds on such as hypothesis testing p values and how to use r which are covered in the first two courses of the statistics for public health if you are unfamiliar with these we suggest you review statistical thinking for public health and linear regression for public health before beginning this if you are already familiar with these we are confident that enjoy furthering your knowledge and in statistics for public health logistic regression for public health we hope you enjoy the
