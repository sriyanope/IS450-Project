total data quality
this aims to explore the total data quality framework in depth and provide learners with more information about the detailed evaluation of total data quality that needs to happen prior to data analysis the goal is for learners to incorporate evaluations of data quality into their process as a critical component for all projects we sincerely hope to disseminate knowledge about total data quality to all learners such as data scientists and quantitative analysts who have not had sufficient training in the initial steps of the data science process that focus on data collection and evaluation of data quality we feel that extensive knowledge of data science techniques and statistical analysis procedures will not help a quantitative research study if the data collectedgathered are not of sufficiently high quality
this will focus on the essential first steps in any type of scientific investigation using data either generating or gathering data understanding where the data come from evaluating the quality of the data and taking steps to maximize the quality of the data prior to performing any kind of statistical analysis or applying data science techniques to answer research questions given this focus there will be little material on the analysis of data which is covered in myriad existing coursera specializations the primary focus of this will be on understanding and maximizing data quality prior to analysis

learners will gain valuable and applicable knowledge and about the total data quality framework from interviews with leading experts area engaging lectures live demonstrations of concepts using software and case studies and will complete practical assessments to solidify concepts and reinforce essential ideas
