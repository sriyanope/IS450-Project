sql for data science capstone
data science is a dynamic and growing field that demands knowledge and skillsbased in sql to be successful this is designed to provide you with a solid foundation in applying sql to analyze data and solve real business problemswhether you have successfully completed the other courses in the sql basics for data science or are taking just this this is your chance to apply the knowledge and you have acquired to practice important sql querying and solve problems with data participate in your own personal or journey to create a portfolioworthy piece from start to finish choose a dataset and develop a proposal explore your data and perform some initial statistics you have learned through this uncover analytics for qualitative data and consider new metrics that make sense from the patterns that surface in your analysis put all of your together in the form of a presentation where tell the story of your findings along the way receive feedback through the peerreview process this community of fellow learners will provide additional input to help you refine your approach to data analysis with sql and present your findings to clients and management

getting started and milestone proposal and data selectionpreparation
first milestone select your client and import your dataset begin to explore your data to understand it and make assumptions about your data draft a proposal to act as a guide as you explore your data and prove or disprove your hypotheses
introduction and welcome milestone introduction the proposal process import of elon musk data initial feature exploration hypotheses entity relationship diagram erd for analysis data models part thinking about your data data models part the evolution of data models data models part relational vs transactional models sql in notebooks import data introduction of data of unknown quality

milestone descriptive stats understanding your data
milestone start to execute your proposal start looking at your data and perform initial statistic models to explore your data and determine what you have available to you
milestone introduction importance of understanding your data foundational stats in sqlsheets pandas teach on stats visualization with raw graphicsio impact of findings on hypotheses statistics refresher optional

milestone beyond descriptive stats dive deepergo broader
milestone go beyond the descriptive statistics you completed in the last milestone this milestone is really about diving deeper to analyze your data beyond descriptive stats maybe you need to analyze qualitative data or textual data to get a full picture
milestone introduction tfidf for word frequency theme analysis text analysis of elon musk tweets create a new metric analyze results

milestone presenting your findings storytelling
milestone present your findings identify your audience and create a presentation tailored to them be able to tell the story of analyses and make recommendations
milestone introduction sample output presentation introduction working with text strings working with date and time strings date and time strings examples case statements views data governance and profiling using sql for data science part using sql for data science part

data wrangling analysis and ab testing with sql
this allows you to apply the sql taught in sql for data science to four increasingly complex and authentic data science inquiry case studies well how to convert timestamps of all types to common formats and perform datetime calculations well select and perform the optimal join for a data science inquiry and clean data within an analysis dataset by deduping running quality checks backfilling and handling nulls well how to segment and analyze data per segment using windowing functions and use case statements to execute conditional logic to address a data science inquiry well also describe how to convert a query into a scheduled job and how to insert data into a date partition finally given a predictive analysis need well engineer a feature from raw data using the tools and weve built over the the realworld application of these will give you the framework for performing the analysis of an ab test

data of unknown quality
be able to create trustworthy analysis from a new set of data be able to coalesce some nulls and identify unreliable data and discover reasons why data might be missing also be able to answer ambiguous questions by defining new metrics
introduction introduction of data of unknown quality introduction to the dataset error codes solution flexible data formats flexible data formats solution identifying unreliable data nulls unreliable data part solution unreliable data part solution unreliable data part solution answering ambiguous questions users table solution

creating clean datasets
be able to name the main the categories of data types be able to explain how the unfiltered data can be manipulated into a table where you can conduct data analysis be able to discuss why a data warehouse is separate from a production database and be able to use the tools you learned to create your own trustworthy tables
creating clean datasets introduction tools of the trade coding guide with sublime text optional data types what is a dependency create a viewitem table turn a clean query into a table activitysolution hierarchy of data create user info table create a user snapshot table activitysolution partitions in hive optional

sql problem solving
be able to map out your joins and be able to highlight the level of detail needed for different kinds of questions be able to practice answering data questions which should help you feel ready to get asked a whole slough of questions vague questions ambiguous questions or even poorly worded questions finally develop a strategy for answering all those questions using data
introduction to sql problem solving map out your joins test queries vs final queries example create an aggregate table with a rolling date period rolling orders solution find each users most recently viewed page for an email campaign review windowing functions promo email solution product analysis product analysis solution coding with style

case study ab testing
be able to use your sql to set up a basic ab testing system be able to apply hypothesis testing to prove or disprove a hypothesis about how user behavior changed be able to test and interpret the results using a metric or metrics that are tied directly to some business metrics be able to test your sql and give you the base you need to anything more complicated in terms of ab testing in the future
how is ab testing used statistics refresher optional test test solution create a new metric creating a new metric solution analyze results analyzing results solution peer review overview
