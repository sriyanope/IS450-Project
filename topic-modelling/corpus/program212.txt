mathematics for computer science
welcome to introduction to numerical mathematics this is designed to give you part of the mathematical foundations needed to in computer science in any of its strands from business to visual digital arts music games at any stage of the problem solving and modelling stage require numerical and computational tools we get you started in binary and other number bases some tools to make sense of sequences of numbers how to represent space numerical using coordinates how to study variations of quantities via functions and their graphs for this we prepared computing and everyday life problems for you to solve using these tools from sending secret messages to designing computer graphics if you wish to take it further you can join the bsc computer science degree and complete the full numerical mathematics enjoy

number bases
we will cover the key concepts place value and number systems about the notion of number bases how to do operate in binary
overview of using numerical mathematics in computing introduction to number bases and modular arithmetic introduction to number bases place value for integers binary to decimal place value for integers decimal to binary place value for fractional numbers binary rational and irrational numbers decimal and binary of binary system and getting ready for operations in binary addition in binary subtraction in binary multiplication in binary review of tasks and context of binary in computing

number bases other bases
we will extend the place value and number systems to octal hexadecimal and any other bases also be introduced to the usefulness of hexadecimal in computer science
octal and hexadecimal integer octal and hexadecimal fractional special relationship between binary and hexadecimal and binary and octal hidden messages inside an image arithmetic in hexadecimaloctal other bases

modular arithmetic
we will cover the key concept of congruence modulo an integer also be introduced to the usefulness of congruence and modular arithmetic operations in computer science

how computers
computers are everywhere they arent just the desktops and laptops we use for but the phones in our pockets and even the watches on our wrists are also computers you probably use a computer every day and in fact you are reading this on a computer just because we use computers all the time doesnt mean that we understand them or find them easy to use computer science is the science of computers it is the field of knowledge that experts use to understand computer systems knowing a little computer science will help you understand the computers all around you this isnt a howto for a particular piece of software instead some fundamental concepts that you can apply to any software or computer system apply these concepts to the kind of computer systems we use every day including word processing applications ecommerce the internet and web sites how to apply computer science concepts to solve problems in daily computer use and generally be a better computer user taking this could be the start of your in computer science and the is an introduction to the bachelors in computer science from university of london but it is also for you if you just want to a little computer science to help you better understand the computers you use in your ordinary life

abstraction
starts your journey into understanding computer science think about how computer science can help you understand the technology you use every day and also one of the most important concepts in computer science abstraction
what is computer science and how can it help us abstraction abstraction in data representations notional machines cpu and memory

state modularity and applications
about the computer science concepts of state and modularity and how they can help you understand the computer applications that you use every day
the deep secret of computer science state an ecommerce site why does turning it off and on again a notional machine files modularity applications debugging

networks
about how computers communicate with each other over networks including the internet also about some of the security threats that the internet entails and how they can be avoided
networks the internet security threats encryption security defenses the perils of the password interview with sarah wiseman

how the web works
apply all of the computer science concepts you have learned to understanding how modern websites
what is a website websites networks and the web security and the web state and the web clients and servers embedding and apis your data mooc
