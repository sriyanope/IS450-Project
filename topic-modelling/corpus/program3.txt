ai foundations for everyone
artificial intelligence ai is no longer science fiction it is rapidly permeating all industries and having a profound impact on virtually every aspect of our existence whether you are an executive a leader an industry a researcher or a student understanding ai its impact and transformative potential for your organization and our society is of paramount importance
this is designed for those with little or no background in ai whether you have technology background or not and does not require any programming it is designed to give you a firm understanding of what is ai its applications and use cases across various industries become acquainted with terms like machine learning deep learning and neural networks
furthermore it will familiarize you with ibm watson ai services that enable any business to quickly and easily employ prebuilt ai smarts to their products and solutions also about creating intelligent virtual assistants and how they can be leveraged in different scenarios
by the end of this learners will have had handson interactions with several ai environments and applications and have built and deployed an ai enabled chatbot on a website without any coding

learners will perform several nocode handson exercises in each of the three courses at the end of the last learners would have developed tested and deployed a watson ai powered customer service chatbot on a website to delight their clients
