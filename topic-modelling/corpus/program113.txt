digital signal processing analog vs digital
digital signal processing is the branch of engineering that in the space of just a few decades has enabled unprecedented levels of interpersonal communication and of ondemand entertainment by reworking the principles of electronics telecommunication and computer science into a unifying paradigm dsp is a the heart of the digital revolution that brought us cds dvds mp players mobile phones and countless other devices the goal for students of this will be to the fundamentals of digital signal processing from the ground up starting from the basic definition of a discretetime signal we will our way through fourier analysis filter design sampling interpolation and quantization to build a dsp toolset complete enough to analyze a practical communication system in detail handson examples and demonstration will be routinely used to close the gap between theory and practice to make the best of this class it is recommended that you are proficient in basic calculus and linear algebra several programming examples will be provided in the form of python notebooks but you can use your favorite programming language to test the algorithms described in the
