<DOC>r basics
regardless of the programming language you use all share some commonalities for example likely need to perform basic operations on different data types like applying mathematical equations to numeric data also need an environment in which to write your code anbbd most modern integrated development environments or ides provide features that make writing code easier like syntax checking color coding and integrated help this introduces you to the r language its common data types and techniques for manipulating them also about the role of the r interpreter and how it transforms code into executable objects finally be introduced to two of the most common ides for r development rstudio and jupyter notebook

<DOC>common data structures
the r language supports many types of data structures that you can use to organize and store values in your code including vectors factors lists arrays matrices and data frames each data structure type serves a specific purpose and can contain specific kinds of data so its important to understand the differences between them so you can make the right choice based on your scenario about the types of data you can store in each data structure and how to add remove or manipulate its contents
vectors and factors vector operations lists arrays and matrices data frames
</DOC>

<DOC>r programming fundamentals
as with most programming languages r supports coding features that you can use to control the flow of execution define functions that can perform specific tasks with common data types like strings and dates and make your code more robust by intercepting likely errors and handling them before they interrupt the execution of your code how to implement these fundamental programming tasks in r
conditions and loops functions in r string operations in r regular expressions date format in r debugging
</DOC>

<DOC>working with data
data is everywhere the data you need to analyze may come from a traditional database but it may also come from a variety of different sources and systems and it may come to you in one or more formats for example your data might be in text excel json or xml files or it may not be stored in a file at all but instead lives on the pages of a website how will you take all these different file formats and load them into your r working environment this provides you with the tools you need to read data from some common file formats and sources into data objects that you can then use and combine with other data objects in your data analysis
