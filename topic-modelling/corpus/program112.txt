hypothesisdriven development
to deliver agile you have to do more than implement agile processes you have to create focus around what matters to your user and constantly test your ideas this is easier said than done but most of todays highfunctioning innovators have a strong culture of experimentationin this how to identify the right questions at the right time and pair them with the right methods to do just enough testing to make sure you minimize waste and maximize the you create with your user this is supported by the batten institute at uvas darden school of business the batten institutes mission is to improve the world through entrepreneurship and innovation wwwbatteninstituteorg
