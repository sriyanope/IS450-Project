complex cash flow analysis
considers more complex cash flow scenarios involving multiple cash flows perpetuities and the impact of multiple compounding interest periods per year many practical problems are worked both analytically and with spreadsheets
introduction introduction mechanics time value of money part compounding interest rates some practical examples

project valuation techniques
project valuation determines whether the financial benefits are greater than the required investment there are three primary valuation metrics used in business the net present value the payback period and the internal rate of return this explores how to determine these metrics both analytically and using spreadsheet analyses
introduction introduction to project valuation discounted cash flow analysis net present value excel to the rescue payback period analysis internal rate of return irr examples with excel

project selection techniques
project valuation criteria such as the npv and irr determine whether a projects financial benefits are greater than the required investment companies use these metrics to select projects for funding during the annual capital budgeting process technical managers also make investment decisions but are often constrained to select only one alternative from several good ones this covers several project selection techniques to ensure the best project is selected
introduction the capital budgeting process project selection and the mirr the discount rate and the wacc incremental cash flow analysis

depreciation taxes and inflation

building the business case

introduction the budgeting process budgeting for profit centers part budgeting for profit centers part budgeting for cost centers qualitative forecasting techniques quantitative forecasting techniques

risk management techniques
forecasting future revenues and costs for a project invariably involves uncertainty and such uncertainty equates to financial risk the greater the uncertainty the greater the risk risk management is about mitigating financial risk by assessing a projects valuation under a range of different conditions identifying the variables that most contribute to risk and creating a plan to minimize the likelihood of any financial downside
