using graphs to describe data
in our study of statistics we many methods to help us summarize analyze and interpret data with the aim of making informed decisions in an uncertain environment first we introduce tables and graphs that help us get a handle of data these tools provide visual support for better decision making with this in mind guide you through the concept of decisions based on incomplete information beginning from here introduce you to the concept of population vs sample of parameter vs statistic and of descriptive statistics vs inferential statistics then go through the concept of describing data and introduce the idea of creating and interpreting graphs to describe categorical and continuous random variables
welcome to statistics for international business introduction using graphs to describe data decision making in an uncertain environment population and sample parameters and statistics descriptive and inferential statistics graphs to describe numerical values shape of a distribution

using measures to describe data
describe and summarize the information in the data using numerical values or measures that are able to summarise information this is a crucial extension to the analysis of the previous while graphs are informative it is usually crucial for improved understanding of the data at hand to discuss their numerical properties look at a range of measures such as measures of central tendency the range variance standard deviation and so on
introduction using measures to describe data descriptive statistics using measures to describe data measures of central tendency and location mean median and mode which is best shape of a distribution measures of variability measures of variability examples weighted mean measures of relationships between variables

probability and probability distributions
probability theory is a young arrival in mathematics and probability applied to practice is almost nonexistent as a discipline we should all understand probability and this lecture will help you to do that its important for you to understand first that the world in which your future occurs is not deterministic and there are future where a probability model cannot be developed cover the basic definition of probability the rules of probabilityrandom variables probability density functions expectations of a random variable and bivariate random variables
probability and probability distributions an introduction introduction random experiment events probability the definition of probability probability rules the addition rule of probabilities conditional probability the multiplication rule of probabilities random variables the probability distribution function properties of discrete random variables the variance of a discrete random variable continuous random variables the probability density function the expectations for continuous random variables probability and probability distributions

statistical estimation
for statistical analysis to properly its essential to have a proper sample drawn from a population of items of interest that have measured characteristics cover statistical estimation sampling distribution of the mean point estimation interval estimation hypothesis testing the null hypothesis and look at some real life examples of their use
statistical estimation an introduction statistical estimation estimator and estimate point estimator and point estimate unbiased efficiency confidence interval estimation confidence intervals part confidence intervals part testing hypothesis formulation of the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis test statistic the decision rule types of errors performing the test and the decision rule hypothesis testing examples regression model statistical estimation further on the linear regression model deriving the ols b the statistical properties of the ols b gaussmarcov theorem proof
