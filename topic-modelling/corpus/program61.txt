network security
welcome to of of this network security
look at computer networking and securing the network in todays world the internet connects nearly everyone and everything and this is accomplished through networking while most see computer networking as a positive criminals routinely use the internet and the networking protocols themselves as weapons and tools to exploit vulnerabilities and for this reason we must do our best to secure the network review the basic components of a network threats and attacks to the network and how to protect them from attackers network security itself can be a specialty within cybersecurity
however all information security professionals need to understand how networks operate and are exploited to better secure them after completing this chapter the participant will be able to explain the concepts of network security recognize common networking terms and models identify common protocols and ports and their secure counterparts identify types of network cyber threats and attacks discuss common tools used to identify and prevent threats identify common data center terminology recognize common cloud service terminology identify secure network design terminology practice the terminology of and review network security concepts agenda introduction network concepts and models common network threats and attacks network security infrastructure network security review this training is for it professionals changers college students recent college graduates advanced high school students and recent high school graduates looking to start their path toward cybersecurity leadership by taking the certified in cybersecurity entrylevel exam there are no prerequisites to take the training or the exam it is recommended that candidates have basic information technology it knowledge no in cybersecurity or formal education diplomadegree is required
