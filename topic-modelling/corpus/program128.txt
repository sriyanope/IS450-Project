surveillance systems analysis dissemination and special systems
build on the previous lessons to focus on some very specific related to public health surveillance how to get the most out of surveillance data analysis focusing specifically on interpreting time trend data to detect temporal aberrations as as person place and time in the context of surveillance data also explore strategies for the presentation of surveillance data and some of the complex legal elements that affect its use then turn our attention to surveillance of noncommunicable chronic diseases and how the data can be used to support prevention efforts finally explore special surveillance systems such as syndromic surveillance antimicrobial resistance and eventrelated surveillance this is designed for public health practitioners with a focus on those working on health surveillance in municipal regional state provincial or even national public health agencies we really think that this will help those with an interest in health surveillance to see which approaches are used in actual practice of public health

analyses of surveillance data
first were going to focus on the analyses used in health surveillance specifically were going to talk about how to interpret time trend data thats harnessed as part of health surveillance programs and strategies used to detect temporal aberrations were also going to build on some of your earlier lessons on descriptive epidemiology with a real focus on how it can be used in the analyses of person place and time in the context of surveillance data i really want to highlight throughout the how we often underutilize surveillance data to analyze complex issues but i also want to talk about the some of the limitations that exist within the data sets
introduction to introduction to analyses of surveillance data surveillance analysis methodological considerations in surveillance analysis assessing trends with temporal and geographic data assessing trends with geographic data assessing trends with personlevel data of analysis and interpretation of surveillance data

dissemination strategies and communication frameworks
explore strategies for the presentation of surveillance data and some of the complex legal elements that affect the use of health surveillance data now surveillance data are fundamentally different from research data in research studies people provide explicit consent for how their data are going to be used for surveillance data the collection doesnt include explicit consent as a result there are very specific laws governing how the data can and should be used to drive public health programs also discuss communication strategies in health surveillance given how sensitive it can be to message health surveillance data and the associated recommendations that come along with communicating these data
introduction to dissemination strategies and communication frameworks presenting surveillance data presenting surveillance map data flow of surveillance data and privacy issues communicating surveillance data

chronic disease surveillance systems
so were switching gears today from communicable diseases to noncommunicable diseases or often called chronic diseases ill present some of the frameworks and approaches that have been developed to guide chronic disease surveillance and then ill focus on giving different examples of these ranging from cancer to cardiovascular health systems taking you back to the surveillance cycle from dr gurleys surveillance systems building blocks ill provide some context on how these chronic disease surveillance systems can really impact chronic disease prevention strategies if communicated effectively and that brings us back to communication where again focus on approaches to communicate these complex issues and then give an example of how to apply communication framework in the context of a chronic disease
introduction to chronic disease surveillance systems chronic disease prevention strategies centers for disease control cdc surveillance systems data sources in chronic disease surveillance chronic disease surveillance targets surveys in chronic disease surveillance

special surveillance systems
i will discuss some of the really interesting special surveillance systems although having standardized approaches for infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases is fundamentally important there are also some health issues that do not fit nicely into these boxes and its here where these special surveillance systems can really play an important role as see having a framework or approach to the issue is still relevant but the approaches are really tailored to the issue at hand start by discussing syndromic surveillance systems including when to use them and also how to design them then really evaluate the differences between indicator versus eventdriven surveillance systems then move on to antimicrobial resistance surveillance systems and then talk in more detail about eventrelated surveillance systems
introduction to special surveillance systems syndromic surveillance systems syndromic surveillance indicator vs eventbased surveillance system examples antimicrobial resistance surveillance system eventrelated surveillance system conclusions

surveillance systems the building blocks
epidemiology is often described as the cornerstone science and public health and public health surveillance is a cornerstone of epidemiology this will help you build your technical awareness and for working with a variety of surveillance systems along the way focus on system objectives data reporting the core surveillance attributes and performance assessment this is designed for public health practitioners and anyone who wants to more about the basics of public health surveillance if you develop or implement surveillance systems or aspire to do so or use the data resulting from surveillance then this is for you its s also for people who are interested in understanding more about this fundamental epidemiologic tool and public health practice

surveillance as a core public health function
in the first were going to review the history of public health surveillance and discuss its role in improving public health surveillance is one of the most basic ways that public health practitioners monitor the health and wellbeing of populations understanding how these data are used is essential in addition to reviewing what public health surveillance is discuss examples of international surveillance networks and domestic surveillance networks in the united states many surveillance systems are very localized but in an increasingly connected world the need for integrated and collaborative surveillance platforms continues to grow by the end of this i hope see how fundamental surveillance is to public health practice
introduction to introduction to surveillance as a core public health function surveillance defined a history of public health surveillance data for action example of an international public health surveillance system example of a domestic public health surveillance system using alternative public health surveillance tools reflecting on surveillance in your life

defining surveillance objectives
discuss examples of surveillance objectives and the considerations that go into deciding what the objective should be and how this must be balanced with public health goals and available resources clear thinking about the objective for surveillance system will guide every decision from how to define your cases to where to look for them and what kinds if any of diagnostic test to use ill provide you with real world example of a public health surveillance system to give you the to wrangle with how to design a surveillance system based on its objectives exercise that no surveillance system is perfect but they can be wellsuited for a specific purpose
introduction to defining surveillance objectives and detecting cases what is the surveillance objective examples of surveillance objectives surveillance case definitions balancing workload with quality crafting a case definition for nipah virus surveillance in bangladesh surveillance as an observational process

surveillance data reporting systems
discuss what happens with data that are generated from public health surveillance recall that public health surveillance data are collected to spur public health action and decisionmaking so talk about how this reporting occurs think through all the various audiences who will use data from a surveillance system present examples from international and domestic surveillance systems in the united states to give you an to identify who would expect to have a report from some specific public health surveillance systems at the end of this be able to describe how public health data are communicated for public health action and how important stakeholders are identified
introduction to surveillance data reporting systems data reporting as part of the surveillance cycle japanese encephalitis surveillance in bangladesh identifying stakeholders international health regulations ihr national notifiable diseases surveillance system nndss

surveillance system attributes and assessing performance
final introduce you to various surveillance attributes we use to describe the performance of public health surveillance systems while no surveillance systems is perfect we need to be able to systematically evaluate the utility of the surveillance and compare surveillance systems the us centers for disease control and prevention have a list of surveillance attributes which are commonly used globally and review those think about these attributes and performance characteristics within the context of two separate public health surveillance systems one for an infectious disease and one for a chronic disease

outbreaks and epidemics
epidemiologists are often called on to investigate outbreaks and epidemics this serves as an introduction to the essentials of investigation identifying pathogens figuring out whats going on reporting and responding how to ask precise epidemiologic questions and apply epidemiologic tools to uncover the answers also about basic epidemic dynamics and the terrible law that cause them to grow as as the reasons why they recede and eventually go away the concludes with deep dives into some real outbreaks from ebola in west africa to the opioid epidemic in the united states

identifying and investigating outbreaks the basics
were going to be talking about outbreaks all the way through identifying the pathogens and figuring out whats going on to reporting and responding to the outbreak in doing so were going to several important epidemiological concepts
introduction to and identifying and investigating outbreaks the basics step what is an outbreak step identify cases step describe the outbreak by person place and time step identify and characterize the cause step risk factor study in a defined population step risk factor study in an open population step intervene and report

weighing evidence and identifying causes

data and health indicators in public health practice
epidemiology is often described as the cornerstone science in public health epidemiology in public health practice uses study design and analyses to identify causes in an outbreak situation guides interventions to improve population health and evaluates programs and policies
define the role of the epidemiologist as it relates to public health services functions and competencies with that foundation in mind introduce you to the problem solving methodology and demonstrate how it can be used in a wide variety of settings to identify problems propose solutions and evaluate interventions this methodology depends on the use of reliable data so take a deep dive into the routine and public health data systems that lie at the heart of epidemiology and then conclude with how you can use that data to calculate measures of disease burden in populations

introduction and problemsolving methodology
introduce the problem solving methodology this methodology is a powerful tool that can useful when identifying a public health problem building the case that there truly is a problem suggesting interventions and suggestions ways to evaluate the interventions and disseminate the findings of the evaluation
welcome to epidemiology methods in public health practice welcome to problemsolving methodology introduction to methodology problem definition part problem definition part magnitude of the problem conceptual framework action plan actions and evaluations communication

data sources in public health
we dive deeper into what lies at the heart of epidemiology data more specifically look at routine and public health data systems
welcome to data sources in public health data for public health practice medical record systems administrative record systems assessing the quality of mortality statistics in the americas public health information systems populationbased surveys public health information systems registries public health information systems surveillance systems common problems of routine and public health information systems

measures of disease burden
use data from routine and public health information systems to measure the burden of disease in the population calculate crude mortality rates and then apply direct and indirect age standardization methods
welcome to measures of disease burden measures of disease burden direct age adjustment indirect age adjustment years of potential life lost life expectancy disabilityadjusted life years daly qualityadjusted life years qaly

health indicators
discuss health indicators which are important measurements of the health of a population there are numerous health indicators that help us paint the picture of a populations health talk about characteristics of good health indicators to provide a little guidance on how to choose health indicators for the public health problem of interest then use the example of the health indicator of liver cancer incidence to explore descriptive epidemiology stratify liver cancer incidence by person place and time to build our in descriptive epidemiology

essential epidemiologic tools for public health practice
in order to make a difference in the health and wellbeing of a population we must understand the burden of all problems and conditions that affect the population as as how our efforts to mitigate these problems are actually working this provides you with some essential and tools that will enhance your ability to describe and understand the health of your community the tools that epidemiologists use are in fact useful for all public health practitioners including data scientists officials agency leaders and policymakers whether you are deeply enmeshed in your and looking to augment your or are looking to change paths into the field of public health this will give you some of the practical knowledge and that we hope you can apply in your endeavors

role of epidemiology in public health
start by discussing the definitions of public health and epidemiology and discuss what components of individuals and their lives that we must address in order to optimize their health and wellbeing section also introduce the handson exercise for this
introduction to introduction to role of epidemiology in public health definition of epidemiology history of epidemiology essential public health services public health governance reflection on competency assessment tool exercise

numeric estimates in epidemiology
examine the definitions for and sources of the core numeric values we need to describe the health and wellbeing of a population which are numerators the counts of an event or disease and the denominator the population from which events are drawn then manipulate those numbers to derive ratios proportions and rates which are core measures used to describe the burden of public health problems
introduction to numeric estimates in epidemiology numerators denominators ratios and proportions rates

depiction of epidemiologic data
explore the tool of data visualization understand basic components of effective visualizations and walk through practical exercises of identifying strengths and weaknesses of specific visualizations towards meeting their stated goals then have the to create a data visualization from data regarding risk factors for common public health problems using the global diseaseburden database of the institute for health metrics and evaluation
introduction to depiction of epidemiologic data data visualization definition and basic risk factors in public health create a visualization graphs in public health

basic mapping of epidemiologic data
maps and geographic information systems have become a cornerstone in public health and epidemiologic in all communities discuss how place matters in public health and how understanding the geographic distribution of a disease or risk factor is an important component of designing appropriate interventions then discuss gis as a tool for displaying spacial data and conduct a detailed exploration of how spatial data is stored and displayed by gis software download an open source gis application known as qgis extract both spatial and epidemiologic data from the us census bureau and create a map of your own
