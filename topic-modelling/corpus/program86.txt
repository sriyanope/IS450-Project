data analysis with r
to analyze and visualize data in r and create reproducible data analysis reports demonstrate a conceptual understanding of the unified nature of statistical inference perform frequentist and bayesian statistical inference and modeling to understand natural phenomena and make databased decisions communicate statistical results correctly effectively and in context without relying on statistical jargon critique databased claims and evaluated databased decisions and wrangle and visualize data with r packages for data analysis applied projectyou will produce a portfolio of data analysis from the that demonstrates mastery of statistical data analysis from exploratory analysis to inference to modeling suitable for applying for statistical analysis or data scientist positions

inferential statistics
this covers commonly used statistical inference methods for numerical and categorical data how to set up and perform hypothesis tests interpret pvalues and report the results of your analysis in a way that is interpretable for clients or the public using numerous data examples to report estimates of quantities in a way that expresses the uncertainty of the quantity of interest be guided through installing and using r and rstudio free statistical software and will use this software for lab exercises and a final the introduces practical tools for performing data analysis and explores the fundamental concepts necessary to interpret and report results for both categorical and numerical data

about the and the
this short introduces basics about coursera specializations and courses in general this statistics with r and this inferential statistics please take several minutes to browse them through thanks for joining us

central limit theorem and confidence interval
welcome to inferential statistics we will discuss foundations for inference check out the objectives start watching the and finally on the quiz and the labs of in addition to that introduce new concepts also see a few that walk you through application examples related to the weeks topics in the first we will introduce central limit theorem clt and confidence interval
introduction sampling variability and clt clt for the mean examples confidence interval for a mean accuracy vs precision required sample size for me ci for the mean examples

inference and significance
welcome to two we will discuss formal hypothesis testing and relate testing procedures back to estimation via confidence intervals these topics will be introduced within the context of working with a population mean however we will also give you a brief peek at whats to come in the next two weeks by discussing how the methods were can be extended to other estimators we will also discuss crucial considerations like decision errors and statistical vs practical significance the labs for will illustrate concepts of sampling distributions and confidence levels
another introduction to inference hypothesis testing for a mean ht for the mean examples inference for other estimators decision errors significance vs confidence level statistical vs practical significance

inference for comparing means
welcome to three of the we will introduce the tdistribution and comparing means as well as a simulation based method for creating a confidence interval bootstrapping if you have questions or discussions please use this weeks forum to askdiscuss with peers
introduction tdistribution inference for a mean inference for comparing two independent means inference for comparing two paired means power comparing more than two means anova conditions for anova multiple comparisons bootstrapping

inference for proportions
welcome to four of our unit well discuss inference for categorical data we use methods introduced to answer questions like what proportion of the american public approves of the job of the supreme court is doing also use the data set provided to complete and report on a data analysis question please read the instructions to complete this selfassessment
introduction sampling variability and clt for proportions confidence interval for a proportion hypothesis test for a proportion estimating the difference between two proportions hypothesis test for comparing two proportions small sample proportions examples comparing two small sample proportions chisquare gof test the chisquare independence test

linear regression and modeling
this introduces simple and multiple linear regression models these models allow you to assess the relationship between variables in a data set and a continuous response variable is there a relationship between the physical attractiveness of a professor and their student evaluation scores can we predict the test score for a child based on certain characteristics of his or her mother the fundamental theory behind linear regression and through data examples to fit examine and utilize regression models to examine relationships between multiple variables using the free statistical software r and rstudio

linear regression
well introduce linear regression many of you may be familiar with regression from reading the news where graphs with straight lines are overlaid on scatterplots linear models can be used for prediction or to evaluate whether there is a linear relationship between two numerical variables
introduction correlation residuals least squares line prediction and extrapolation conditions for linear regression r squared regression with categorical explanatory variables

more about linear regression
welcome to we will look at outliers inference in linear regression and variability partitioning please use to strengthen your understanding on linear regression dont forget to post your questions concerns and suggestions in the discussion forum
outliers in regression inference for linear regression variability partitioning

multiple regression
well explore multiple regression which allows us to model numerical response variables using multiple predictors numerical and categorical we will also cover inference for multiple linear regression model selection and model diagnostics there is also a final included use the data set provided to complete and report on a data analysis question please read the instructions to complete this selfassessment
introduction multiple predictors adjusted r squared collinearity and parsimony inference for mlr model selection diagnostics for mlr

introduction to probability and data with r
this introduces you to sampling and exploring data as well as basic probability theory and bayes rule examine various types of sampling methods and discuss how such methods can impact the scope of inference a variety of exploratory data analysis techniques will be covered including numeric statistics and basic data visualization be guided through installing and using r and rstudio free statistical software and will use this software for lab exercises and a final the concepts and techniques will serve as building blocks for the inference and modeling courses in the

about introduction to probability and data
this introduces you to sampling and exploring data as well as basic probability theory examine various types of sampling methods and discuss how such methods can impact the utility of a data analysis the concepts will serve as building blocks for our later courseseach lesson comes with a set of objectives that will be covered in a series of short supplementary and practice problems will also be suggested from openintro statistics rd edition httpsleanpubcomopenintrostatistics a free online introductory statistics textbook that i coauthored there will be weekly quizzes designed to assess your and mastery of the material covered that in the in addition each will also feature a lab in which use r to apply what you are to real data there will also be a data analysis designed to enable you to answer research questions of your own choosing since this is a coursera you are welcome to participate as much or as little as youd like though i hope that begin by participating fully one of the most rewarding aspects of a coursera is participation in forum discussions about the materials please take advantage of other students feedback and insight and contribute your own perspective where you see fit to do so you can also check out the resource page httpswwwcourseraorglearnprobabilityintroresourcescrmc listing useful resources for this thank you for joining the introduction to probability and data community say hello in the discussion forums we are looking forward to your participation in the

introduction to data
