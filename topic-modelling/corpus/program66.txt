cloud computing law transactions
have you ever wondered whats in the small print of cloud contracts or who owns the information you upload to the cloud and who can access and control it if so then this is for you to identify the legal risks involved in cloud computing transactions and to suggest possible solutions
to understand how cloud computing works first describe different kinds of cloud services and explain how they differ from inhouse it in terms of control access and cybersecurity to understand how the law applies to cloud computing transactions focus on the contracts between cloud providers and their customers to identify and interpret key contract terms and to assess whether customers might negotiate better terms with providers finally explain how english law protects trade secrets and copyright works stored in the cloud if youre a lawyer this will be your guide to cloud infrastructure and supply chains if you have a technical or commercial background this will introduce you to key legal issues in contracts and intellectual property in short if youre interested in how the law applies to cloud computing this is for you

understanding cloud computing
we cover the basics of cloud computing we look at how cloud computing technology works and how it differs from traditional inhouse it we explain that cloud is not one thing instead there are different service types and deployment models as as socalled layered services we then look at the legal implications of different cloud services finally we consider the importance of data location and the relationship between cloud customers and providers by the end of be able to identify the legal and regulatory risks that a potential cloud customer should consider
welcome to cloud computing law what will we cover what is cloud computing anyway whats so great about cloud computing where are cloud data stored how does cloud scalability what are the different cloud service types what are the different cloud deployment models what is cloud layering is cloud computing secure how do you manage cybersecurity in the cloud do service types and deployment models matter for security

standard cloud contracts
the relationship between the cloud customer and the provider is governed by contract cloud contracts set out the parties rights and obligations they also cover issues such as choice of law and forum liability in case of breach of contract how changes might be made and what happens when a contract is terminated we look at the clauses typically found in standard cloud contracts and what these might mean in practice for both customers and providers we highlight how these clauses can differ per provider and how cloud contracts differ from other it contracts such as those for outsourcing and ip licensing by the end of you should describe the terms a cloud customer is likely to find in standard cloud contracts
welcome to cloud contracts what is a contract and how is it formed how are cloud contracts formed can you choose the applicable law who are the contracting parties to cloud contracts do cloud contracts contain choice of law clauses can you choose forum arbitration do cloud contracts contain choice of forum clauses which remedies are available for breach of contract what are cloud providers duties under contract what do cloud contracts say about remedies can you limit liability under english law can a provider terminate your account

negotiated cloud contracts
standard cloud contracts typically favour the provider however large businesses or government departments can sometimes negotiate more favourable terms with cloud providers we look at the factors that influence whether cloud providers will negotiate terms with customers as as the terms customers want to negotiate and how those negotiations typically develop by the end of be able to describe a cloud customers prospects for negotiating contract terms with a cloud provider
welcome to cloud contract negotiations will cloud providers negotiate which terms do customers negotiate do cloud negotiations differ from outsourcing software licenses can you negotiate liability terms can you negotiate clauses related to security can you negotiate audit rights can you negotiate terms related to data location do regulations impact cloud negotiations

intellectual property in the cloud
we look at questions of ownership of information stored created processed and distributed in cloud environments we examine the information flows between cloud providers and their customers and distinguish between content that is stored and processed by users from information generated by cloud providers see that although intellectual property law may determine ownership rights in relevant information the law does not necessarily achieve what parties to cloud computing transactions expect or need moreover in practice ownership may be less important than control over and access to information by the end of be able to describe how a cloud customer can protect and control information in the cloud
welcome to ip in the cloud can you own digital information who are the relevant players how can digital information be controlled control who has it and what are the types how do cloud tos deal with ip licenses is copyright the most relevant ip right how does copyright enable legal control what are trade secrets which types of information do customers generate which types of information do providers generate concluding remarks

cloud computing law data protection and cybersecurity
vast amounts of personal information are processed in the cloud but who is legally responsible for such personal data in cloud environments what duties do cloud providers like amazon microsoft and google have and what rights can you as an individual exercise under data protection law if youd like to find out then this is for you
first look at how the european unions general data protection regulation gdpr regulates the processing of personal data in cloud services to identify controllers and processors describe their roles and responsibilities and understand how cloud customers and providers can comply in practice second look at international transfers of personal data explain how the gdpr can apply to cloud providers and their customers anywhere in the world as as how restrictions on international transfers apply to cloud services third look at how the network and information security nis directive regulates the cybersecurity of critical infrastructure to identify cloud providers duties to notify security breaches and to keep their services secure and how to apply those duties to concrete case studies in short this covers how the gdpr and nis directive apply to cloud services and what cloud providers and their customers should do to comply

protecting personal data in the cloud
how data protection laws regulate the processing of personal data in cloud services focus in particular on the rules applying to cloud service providers and their customers as processors and controllers under the eus general data protection regulation gdpr explore the principles that must be followed and consider the legal grounds for processing personal data in the cloud as as how individuals might exercise their rights and the potential consequences for cloud providers of failing to comply with their obligations by the end of be able to identify what is regulated as personal data and analyse what cloud providers and their customers must do to ensure compliance with the gdpr
introduction to data protection and cybersecurity what is personal data who are the main gdpr actors what are the data protection principles what is lawful processing what do we mean by joint controllers what is the relationship between controllers and processors what are the security obligations what are individual rights what are the gdpr provisions on fines and compensation

international data transfers and cloud services
how the gdpr applies to international transfers of data in cloud computing first examine the broad territorial scope of the gdpr in the context of cloud computing then explore how gdpr may restrict international transfers of cloud data the legal mechanisms that may be relied on to justify regulated transfers and possible exceptions to the transfer restriction by the end of be able to explain the international reach of gdpr and how its data transfer rules apply to cloud providers and their customers
introduction to international data transfers the establishment test targeting and monitoring third country transfer restriction what is a transfer transfer options adequacy decisions appropriate safeguards derogations data transfers conclusion

cybersecurity cloud and critical infrastructure
about the regulation of cloud services as critical infrastructure under the network and information security nis directive first look which cloud services need to comply with this directive then review the obligations to keep cloud services secure and to report security incidents to a regulator by the end of be able to describe how a cloud provider can comply with the nis directive as as the possible penalties for breaking the rules
introduction to the regulation of critical infrastructure what is critical infrastructure how does the nis directive define cloud must cloud providers notify security incidents must cloud providers secure their service how is the nis directive enforced who enforces the nis directive

cloud computing law law enforcement competition tax
have you ever wondered how a police officer in europe can obtain evidence from a cloud provider in the usa or whether a major cloud provider might abuse its market power or in which countries cloud providers pay taxes if so then this is for you
first look at how law enforcement agents can request access to cloud data including data stored outside their borders to advise cloud providers on responding to access requests and on dealing with potential conflicts with european union eu data protection law second cover eu competition law including how to define the relevant market for cloud services and to assess market power to identify when cloud providers might be found to have entered into anticompetitive agreements or to have abused a dominant position in a market third look at how the income from cloud services is taxed cover how such income is classified and which countries have the right to tax cloud providers how tax principles apply to cloud services today and how this might change in future in short cover how the rules of law enforcement access competition law and tax law apply to cloud services and discover the practical steps that cloud providers can take to comply with their obligations

law enforcement access to cloud data
we cover issues that arise when law enforcement authorities need to access data in the cloud we consider how the technology itself presents forensic challenges and how different types of data are treated differently by the law we then focus on issues that law enforcement agents face when they seek data that is controlled by a cloud service provider outside of the territory of the law enforcement authority we discuss the cooperative mechanisms for law enforcement to obtain crossborder data and the conflicting legal obligations that cloud providers may face context by the end of be able to describe how cloud providers can comply with law enforcement access requests
welcome to law enforcement access and the cloud introduction to forensic challenges for digital investigations in the cloud introduction to data differentiation extraterritorial jurisdiction voluntary and mandatory disclosures by cloud service providers voluntary and mandatory disclosures and jurisdiction mutual legal assistance mutual recognition mutual trust conflicts for cloud service providers data protection and cloud service providers

competition law and cloud markets
we cover the basics of competition law and examine how it applies to the provision of cloud computing services further we look at what it means to engage in anticompetitive behaviour in cloud markets and the role of competition law in establishing means to prevent or regulate such behaviour we also explore how interoperability and portability have the ability to both facilitate and hinder competition in the cloud by the end of be able to apply concepts of competition law to practical cases involving cloud services
welcome to competition law what are competitive markets what is market power how are markets defined what are anticompetitive agreements what is abuse of a dominant position how does the law control mergers what is interoperability how can interoperability support competition what is portability could access to data be an essential facility how does competition in digital platforms

taxing the cloud
we cover the basics of tax law and examine how it applies to the provision of cloud computing services we start with some basic international tax law concepts before focusing on the tax treatment of different cloud services we consider the classification of cloud services for tax purposes and how taxing rights are distributed among different countries we focus primarily on direct tax but also briefly refer to indirect tax issues furthermore we look at the challenges digitalization poses to the current international tax framework and explore how countries and policymakers have responded to these challenges by the end of be able to describe a cloud providers potential tax liabilities in a hypothetical case study
welcome to what are the basic international tax principles how are software and hardware taxed how are saas iaas and paas taxed how are mixed cloud contracts taxed when is a permanent establishment created at the server country when is a permanent establishment created at the user country what are the oecd eu un digital tax policy initiatives how might cloud providers be affected by the oecd digital tax policy what indirect tax challenges does the digital economy pose
