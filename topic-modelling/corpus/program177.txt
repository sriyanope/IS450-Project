leading change in health informatics
do you dream of being a cmio or a senior director of clinical informatics if you are aiming to rise up in the ranks in your health system or looking to pivot your in the direction of big data and health it this is made for you hear from experts at johns hopkins about their harnessing the power of big data in healthcare improving ehr adoption and separating out the hope vs hype when it comes to digital medicine
whether youre a nurse pharmacist physician other allied health or come from a nonclinical backgroundyou know that health informatics are in demand
this newly launched by johnshopkins faculty members provides a solid foundation for anyone wanting to become a leader in one of the hottest fields in healthcare as health informaticians we need to be very clear in our understanding of the current state asis the future state tobe and any unintended consequences that can result from our interventions prior to introducing large scale change we need to assess whether a healthcare organization is truly ready for change this involves taking into account an organizations current culture and values successfully leading change through health informatics also requires strategic planning and careful financial considerations proper workflow redesign and a clear change management strategy are of utmost importance when introducing new technologies and in ensuring their successful adoption and proper use
by the end of this students will become familiar with examples of successful and failed attempts at change in health informatics and the reasons for each students will be armed with tools to help optimize their chances for successfully leading change in their respective organizations

the and interventions of health informatics
for clinical data science to be effective in healthcareto achieve the desiredit must translate into decision support of some sort either at the patient clinician or manager level by the end of this students will be able to articulate the need for an intervention to right size it to choose the appropriate technology to describe how knowledge should be obtained and to design a monitoring plan
</DOC>
<DOC>knowing where to intervene
be introduced to the through a range of decision support interventions used in health care examine the five rights of decision support and go on to discuss the basics for deciding whether to build an intervention and having done so how to evaluate it
motivation examples should you should you ii himss framework does it testing is it used does it accomplish goals
</DOC>

<DOC>defining decision support
focus on issues of design both for decision support and as they apply more broadly across multiple environments
clinical decision support types of clinical decision support design phase define phase ideate phase prototype phase test phase deploy phase
</DOC>

<DOC>using transactional and summative data and knowledge for decision support
we return to decision support focusing on rules the key structure in most decision support provide a key framework for making sure you have all the minimum components for ensuring a successful implementation also address issues of languages used by rules and how to keep rules consistent within and between institutions
whats in a rule whats in a rule part ii the language of rules data dictionary and taxonomy value sets semantic networks ontology

the social and technical context of health informatics
improving health and healthcare institutions requires understanding of data and creation of interventions at the many levels at which health it interact and affect the institution these levels range from the external world in which the institution operates down to the specific technologies data scientists find that when they aim at implementing their models in practice it is the socio components that are both novel to them and mission critical to success at the end of this students will be able to make a quick assessment of a health informatics problemor a proposed solutionand to determine what is missing and what more needs to be learned
who is this class for physicians nurses pharmacists social workers and other allied health professionals interested in expanding their understanding of digital health big data health information systems and the unintended consequences of disruptive innovation in the healthcare system the is also aimed at those with technical engineering or analytics backgrounds who want to understand the nuances of those topics when it comes to healthcare

<DOC>workflow information system
we continue the journey starting with the role of needs requirements and specifications we then turn to how workflow issues are turned into requirements and how information systems built to satisfy those requirements are assembled we close with the cautionary notes of how poorly built systems harm the very workflows they were designed to improve
need and system specification articulating workflow information system architecture the comprising clinical information systems developing software harming workflow
</DOC>

<DOC>data information knowledge technology
this concludes our journey with discussions of data information knowledge and technology regarding data we discuss their sources and types and provide examples we go on to explain differences between information and data and between knowledge and information standards are most important at this level and we discuss the exchange of text and imaging data regarding technology we use the hype cycle as a way for you to keep track of what new technologies are doing what and when we close with a framework for thinking about careers in health it and informatics

the data science of health informatics
health data are notable for how many types there are how complex they are and how serious it is to get them straight these data are used for treatment of the patient from whom they derive but also for other uses examples of such secondary use of health data include population health eg who requires more attention research eg which drug is more effective in practice quality eg is the institution meeting benchmarks and translational research eg are new technologies being applied appropriately by the end of this students will recognize the different types of health and healthcare data will articulate a coherent and complete question will interpret queries designed for secondary use of ehr data and will interpret the results of those queries
</DOC>
<DOC>introduction to databases and data types
begin by introducing and defining databases and placing the role of databases within the context of clinical informatics continue by introducing the common health data types such as demographics diagnosis medications procedures and utilization data finish this by reviewing the emerging health data such as lab ordersresults vital signs social data and patientgenerated data

<DOC>formulating data questions
with this understanding of the data available its time to see how to turn questions you and your colleagues will have into queries the database can understand besides getting rules of thumb for doing this translation also be introduced to three online tools available to test some of these also watch an interview with sam meiselman instructor and the data manager in charge of the johns hopkins enterprise data warehouse who has to use these on a daily basis

<DOC>real world applications of data science in health informatics
to send home the recurring message on the challenges and art of translating questions into queries see interviews with two professionals one who comes from the data management side of the equation and one who comes from the domain they will give you perspectives that are both similar the need to understand the problem for which the data are being retrieved and different the multiplicity of data available vs the richness of the domain problem
