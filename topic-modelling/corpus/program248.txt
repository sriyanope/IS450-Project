build a momentumbased trading system
momentum trading is a strategy in which traders buy or sell assets according to the strength of recent price trends price momentum is similar to momentum in physics where mass multiplied by velocity determines the persistence with which an object will follow its current path like a heavy train on a track in financial markets however momentum is determined by other factors like trading volume and rate of price changes momentum traders bet that an asset price that is moving strongly in a given direction will continue to move in that direction until the trend loses strength or reverses this teaches you all about momentum trading
