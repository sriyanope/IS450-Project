exploratory data analysis with matlab
to think like a data scientist and ask questions of your data use interactive features in matlab to extract subsets of data and to compute statistics on groups of related data to use matlab to automatically generate code so you can syntax as you explore also use interactive documents called live scripts to capture the steps of your analysis communicate the results and provide interactive controls allowing others to experiment by selecting groups of data
these are valuable for those who have domain knowledge and some exposure to computational tools but no programming background is required to be successful you should have some knowledge of basic statistics eg histograms averages standard deviation curve fitting interpolation by the end of this be able to load data into matlab prepare it for analysis visualize it perform basic computations and communicate your results to others in your last combine these to assess damages following a severe weather event and communicate a polished recommendation based on your analysis of the data be able to visualize the location of these events on a geographic map and create sliding controls allowing you to quickly visualize how a phenomenon changes over time
