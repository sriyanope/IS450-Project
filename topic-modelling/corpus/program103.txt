design thinking insights to inspiration
welcome designers
developed at the darden school of business at the university of virginia introduce you to the design thinking process it is a projectbased in which identify a humancentered problem that you want to solve focus our attention on the first seven steps of our step design thinking process guide you through crafting and carrying out a research plan that helps you answer the question what is gather and identify important insights about the needs and wants of others and use this information to identify the attributes of an ideal solution

insights into design thinking
welcome to the ready to begin we are going to get off to a fast start be learning some introductory material and starting on your project by completing step

framing the business case embracing the rollercoaster ride as a team step scope your project step draft your design brief health care vignette

what is
after completing your design brief you are ready to move into steps and make plans and begin your research
step make your project plan step make your people plan step make your research plan step do your research ethnographic research example stories ethnographic research choosing good participants ethnographic research conducting interviews the pain curve

the innovation mindset
in continue to on the field for your project there are no new steps to tacklejust keep focusing on getting your field research completed with your field underway we are going to spend our time shifting our focus from the level of process to the level of the personal and ask you to consider your own mindset and repertoire

if anything were possible
welcome to at this point you have hopefully completed your planning and are wrapping up your field research your completed research will be the input that use to mine for deep insights step and then transform those insights into design criteria step
meyouhealth the biggest challenge meyouhealth what is conducting research meyouhealth what is emerging patterns meyouhealth what if generating ideas step identify insights step hosting a gallery walk step establish design criteria capturing your projects payback the impact of expertise

experiencing design deepening your design thinking practice
how do we unlock the transformational power of design thinking to do this we must understand that this power lies not in what it encourages us to do but in who it encourages us to become we become design thinkers by experiencing design
developed at the darden school of business at the university of virginia guide you through six key phases of the design journey immersion sensemaking alignment emergence imagining and learning in action for each of these phases explore how design thinking done impacts innovators by inviting them to bring their authentic selves into the innovation conversation examine key behaviors that bridge the gap from beginner to competency and deepen the that will allow you to achieve design thinkings transformational promise also hear from industry leaders from all over the world who will share valuable lessons and personal stories about how experiencing design has shaped their exciting careers

design thinking ideas to action
welcome designers
developed at the darden school of business at the university of virginia carry on the design thinking process begun in our insights to inspiration beginning with the eighth step in our step process bringing the ideas you developed in our insights to inspiration to action we start this by asking what if use brainstorming in a new and creative way to generate solutions to your challenge and then to take those raw ideas and synthesize them into important concepts by asking what wows and what works to move from ideation to experimentation throughout this journey gather critical that will enable you to turn your ideas into action that can have a profound impact on you and your organization

what if
welcome to the first continue our step process with steps and in which brainstorm ideas and develop concepts related to your chosen project
step brainstorming creating a successful brainstorming environment creating a successful brainstorming session for action step develop concepts taking action and creating concepts

what wows
welcome to we move from hypothesis generation to hypothesis testing and from idea generation to idea evaluation
step create some napkin pitches what napkin pitches can help us do ibm introduction to a process of experimentation ibm the problem and approach ibm what is and what if ibm what wows and what works step surface key assumptions using four tests to define key assumptions setting appropriate test strategies the importance of thought experiments characteristics of a good hypothesis prioritizing ideas using existing data to test assumptions

what wows to what works
in we transition from what wows to what works focus on step and step of your design process
step make prototypes guidelines for making prototypes a continuum of prototyping case study eaton next generation meter case study vision screening kiosk step get feedback from stakeholders introduction to the cocreation tool examples of cocreation using a poster examples of cocreation using card sorts and sticky notes examples of cocreation using a storyboard

what works
in push further into the design and execution of inmarket experiments
step run your learning launches designing a successful learning launch getting started on your learning launch inmarket experiments learning plan timeline thought experiments examples of d and d inmarket experiments life reimagined project a d inmarket experiment the movement in the design thinking journey delivering validated learning against your key assumptions giving and receiving feedback

whats next
its hard to believe but weve reached step the last step we have for you in step we discuss whats next then wrap up our time together with some final thoughts on measuring the impact of design thinking
step whats next importancedifficulty matrix measuring impact staying in the question searching for higher ground helping us curate removing barriers and increasing speed of learning comfort with emptiness and leaving space
