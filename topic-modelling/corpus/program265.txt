quantitative methods
discover the principles of solid scientific methods in the behavioral and social sciences join us and to separate sloppy science from solid research
this will cover the fundamental principles of science some history and philosophy of science research designs measurement sampling and ethics the is comparable to a university level introductory on quantitative research methods in the social sciences but has a strong focus on research integrity use examples from sociology political sciences educational sciences communication sciences and psychology

before we get started
first consider the basic principles of the scientific method its history and its philosophies but before we start talking methods ill give you a broad sense of what the is about and how its organized are you new to coursera or still deciding whether this is the for you then make sure to check out the introduction and what to expect section below so have the essential information you need to decide and to do if you have any questions about the format deadlines or grading probably find the answers here are you a coursera veteran and anxious to get started then you might want to skip ahead to the first topic the origins of the scientific method you can always check the general information later veterans and newbies alike dont forget to introduce yourself in the meet and greet forum
undecided see why you should join welcome to quantitative methods

origins of the scientific method
science is all about gaining knowledge coming up with the best possible explanations of the world around us so how do we decide which explanation is the best one how do we make sure our explanations are accurate how do we determine we actually know something in science we try to resolve these questions by using a set of principles and procedures called the scientific method you need to know its historical and philosophical origin story to really understand the scientific method and to fully appreciate how hard it is to apply the scientific method in the social and behavioral sciences
nonscientific methods scientific method scientific claims classical period enlightenment modern science epistemology ontology approaches goals origins interview gerben moerman part of origins interview gerben moerman part of origins interview gerben moerman part of origins interview gerben moerman part of

the scientific method
in the first we discussed how the scientific method developed general philosophical approaches and the types of knowledge science aims to find second make these abstract principles and concepts a little more concrete by discussing the empirical cycle and causality in more detail see how and in what order these concepts are implemented when we conduct a research study also consider the main criteria for evaluating the methodological quality of a research study validity and reliability the focus will be on internal validity and how internal validity can be threatened
empirical cycle disconfirmation criteria causality internal validity threats participants internal validity threats instruments internal validity threats artificiality internal validity threats research setup variables of interest variables of disinterest scientific method interview marjan bakker part of scientific method interview marjan bakker part of scientific method interview marjan bakker part of

research designs
in the previous we discussed the empirical cycle causality and the criteria for methodological quality focusing on threats to internal validity consider the most frequently used research designs and see how they address threats to internal validity look at experimental quasiexperimental and correlational designs as as some other designs you should be familiar with to understand and appreciate these designs discuss some general concepts such as randomization and matching in a little more detail
true experiments factorial designs repeated measures manipulation lab vs field randomization experimental designs matching quasiexperimental designs correlational designs other designs research designs interview maarten bos part of research designs interview maarten bos part of research designs interview maarten bos part of research designs interview maarten bos part of

measurement
choosing a design is only the first step in the deduction phase remember the empirical cycle the second step is deciding on specific ways to measure the variables of interest and disinterest this step is extremely important because even if we are able to perform a true doubleblind experiment if our measurement and manipulation method are of poor quality then internal validity will still be compromised look at what measurement is exactly and what the criteria for evaluating measurement are also look more indepth at selfreport measures including survey questionnaires and tests these methods are among the most frequently used measurement instruments in the social and behavioral sciences
operationalization measurement structure measurement levels variable types measurement validity measurement reliability survey questionnaire test scales and response options response and rater bias other measurement types measurement interview andries van der ark part of measurement interview andries van der ark part of measurement interview andries van der ark part of measurement interview andries van der ark part of

sampling
in the previous two we discussed research designs and methods to measure and manipulate our variables of interest and disinterest before a researcher can move on to the testing phase and can actually collect data there is just one more procedure that needs to be decided on sampling researchers need to determine who potential participants are and how they will be selected and recruited
external validity threats sampling concepts probability sampling probability sampling simple probability sampling complex nonprobability sampling sampling error nonsampling error sample size sampling interview armn hakhverdian part of sampling interview armn hakhverdian part of sampling interview armn hakhverdian part of sampling interview armn hakhverdian part of

practice ethics integrity
last content focus on the part of the research process that follows data collection the specifics of storing data and using statistics form a topic in their own right see the courses on basic and inferential statistics for now focus on more general issues to do with data interpretation and dissemination of results that relate to ethics and integrity some of the concepts that we discuss here will be familiar if you watched the interviews of the past it might be interesting to rewatch these if you have the time

qualitative research methods
be introduced to the basic ideas behind the qualitative research in social science about data collection analysis and interpretation in qualitative research qualitative research often involves an iterative process focus on the ingredients required for this process data collection and analysis
you wont how to use qualitative methods by just watching so we put much stress on collecting data through observation and interviewing and on analysing and interpreting the collected data in other obviously the most important concepts in qualitative research will be discussed just as discuss quality criteria good practices ethics writing some methods of analysis and mixing methods we hope to take away some prejudice and enthuse many students for qualitative research

philosophy of qualitative research
welcome to the first of the we start with an introduction followed by two lessons on the philosophy of qualitative research
introduction on elephants ontology for social actors ontology for social researchers epistemology hermeneutics phenomenology pragmatism

observation
in the first we discussed the philosophy of qualitative research explaining some basic notions and general philosophical approaches second discuss observation as an important method within qualitative research what types of observation are there how do we observe and how do we analyse and describe our data
ethnography participant observation views on observation observational focus cyclists in amsterdam privatizing public space field notes fieldwork organisation observation and interpretation

good practices criteria
what makes qualitative research good is a rather difficult question different criteria are suggested but within the field of qualitative research there is not much agreement on these criteria however there is quite some agreement on what good practices of qualitative research are start in lesson with a discussion of good practices of qualitative research
flexibility triangulation abduction focus on details and context look for contradiction reflexivity how many cases are enough theoretical saturation criteria for research quality

qualitative interviewing
look at what a qualitative interview entails by trying to define it and by discussing different forms of interviewing behaviour
visions of interviewing typologies of interviews rapport in interviewing powergame or roleplaying probing and prompting probing tactics interviewing a final thought

qualitative analysis
in previous we discussed how you should observe a social situation or conduct a qualitative interview now focus on what to do with your data by discussing qualitative analysis try to do a qualitative analysis by interpreting your observed data and try to code it
qualitative analysis code and retrieve framework analysis analytic induction grounded theory versions of grounded theory

writing mixing ethics
i will discuss ideas on writing in qualitative research i will discuss mixing methods and talk about the ethical issues you should consider
qualitative writing mixing methods how to mix five focal points in ethics ethics visions practices ethical boards qualitative research fraud

catch up
theres no new material the only requirement is that you finish up the final peer review

exam
this is the final where you can apply everything youve learned up until now in the final exam please note that you can only take the final exam once every day so make sure you are fully prepared to take the test please follow the honor code and do not communicate or confer with others taking this exam good luck once youve taken the exam please consider doing the other courses in our track i hope it was an enjoyable if it was please consider joining in with the massive open online research by my colleague christian brer thanks for all your hard feedback and interpretations the team and your fellow learners really appreciate it

inferential statistics
inferential statistics are concerned with making inferences based on relations found in the sample to relations in the population inferential statistics help us decide for example whether the differences between groups that we see in our data are strong enough to provide support for our hypothesis that group differences exist in general in the entire population
start by considering the basic principles of significance testing the sampling and test statistic distribution pvalue significance level power and type i and type ii errors then consider a large number of statistical tests and techniques that help us make inferences for different types of data and different types of research designs for each individual statistical test consider how it works for what data and design it is appropriate and how results should be interpreted also how to perform these tests using freely available software for those who are already familiar with statistical testing look at ztests for and proportions mcnemars test for dependent proportions ttests for mean paired differences and means the chisquare test for independence fishers exact test simple regression linear and exponential and multiple regression linear and logistic one way and factorial analysis of variance and nonparametric tests wilcoxon kruskalwallis sign test signedrank test runs test

before we get started
formatted text here

comparing two groups
second of we dive right in with a quick refresher on statistical hypothesis testing since were assuming you just completed the basic statistics our treatment is a little more abstract and we go really fast we provide the relevant basic statistics in case you need a gentler introduction after the refresher we discuss methods to compare two groups on a categorical or quantitative dependent variable we use different test for independent and dependent groups
null hypothesis testing pvalues confidence intervals and twosided tests power two independent proportions two independent means two dependent proportions two dependent means controlling for other variables

categorical association
we tackle categorical association mainly discuss the chisquared test that allows us to decide whether two categorical variables are related in the population if two categorical variables are unrelated you would expect that categories of these variables dont go together you would expect the number of cases in each category of one variable to be proportionally similar at each level of the other variable the chisquared test helps us to compare the actual number of cases for each combination of categories the joint frequencies to the expected number of cases if the variables are unrelated
categorical association and independence the chisquared test interpreting the chisquared test chisquared as goodnessoffit the chisquared test sidenotes fishers exact test

simple regression
see how to describe the association between two quantitative variables using simple linear regression analysis regression analysis allows us to model the relation between two quantitative variables and based on our sample decide whether a real relation exists in the population regression analysis is more useful than just calculating a correlation coefficient since it allows us assess how our regression line fits the data it helps us to identify outliers and to predict scores on the dependent variable for new cases
the regression line the regression equation the regression model predictive power pitfalls in regression testing the model checking assumptions ci and pi for predicted values exponential regression

multiple regression
see how we can use more than one predictor to describe or predict a quantitative variable in the social sciences relations between psychological and social variables are generally not very strong since are generally influences by complex processes involving many variables so it really helps to be able to describe an variable with several predictors not just to increase the fit of the model but also to assess the individual contribution of each predictor while controlling for the others
regression model r and rsquared overall test individual tests checking assumptions categorical predictors categorical response variable interpreting results

analysis of variance
discuss analysis of variance a very popular technique that allows us to compare more than two groups on a quantitative dependent variable the reason we call it analysis of variance is because we compare two estimates of the variance in the population if the group means differ in the population then these variance estimates differ just like in multiple regression factorial analysis of variance allows us to investigate the influence of several independent variables
oneway anova oneway anova assumptions and ftest oneway anova posthoc ttests factorial anova factorial anova assumptions and tests anova and regression

nonparametric tests
discuss the last topic of this nonparametric tests until now weve mostly considered tests that require assumptions about the shape of the distribution ztests ttests and ftests sometimes those assumptions dont hold nonparametric tests require fewer of those assumptions there are several nonparametric tests that correspond to the parametric z t and ftests these tests also come in handy when the response variable is an ordered categorical variable as opposed to a quantitative variable there are also nonparametric equivalents to the correlation coefficient and some tests that have no parametriccounterparts
nonparametric tests why and when the sign test one sample wilcoxon signed rank test two samples wilcoxonmannwhitney test several samples kruskalwallis test spearman correlation the runs test

exam time
final theres no new material to study we advise you to take some extra time to review the material from the previous and to practice for the final exam weve provided a practice exam that you can take as many times as you like the final exam is structured exactly like the practice exam so you know what to expect please note that you can only take the final exam twice every seven days so make sure you are fully prepared please follow the honor code and do not communicate or confer with others while taking this exam or after in the open questions of the exam ie those that are not multiple choice you should report your answers to decimal places and use decimal places in your calculations good luck

basic statistics
understanding statistics is essential to understand research in the social and behavioral sciences the basics of statistics
not just how to calculate them but also how to evaluate them this will also prepare you for the next in the the inferential statistics
in the first part of the discuss methods of descriptive statistics what cases and variables are and how you can compute measures of central tendency mean median and mode and dispersion standard deviation and variance next we discuss how to assess relationships between variables and we introduce the concepts correlation and regression the second part of the is concerned with the basics of probability calculating probabilities probability distributions and sampling distributions you need to know about these things in order to understand how inferential statistics the third part of the consists of an introduction to methods of inferential statistics methods that help us decide whether the patterns we see in our data are strong enough to draw conclusions about the underlying population we are interested in discuss confidence intervals and significance tests not only about all these statistical concepts also be trained to calculate and generate these statistics yourself using freely available statistical software

before we get started
consider the basics of statistics but before we start give you a broad sense of what the is about and how its organized are you new to coursera or still deciding whether this is the for you then make sure to check out the introduction and what to expect from this sections below so have the essential information you need to decide and to do if you have any questions about the format deadlines or grading probably find the answers here are you a coursera veteran and ready to get started then you might want to skip ahead to the first topic exploring data you can always check the general information later veterans and newbies alike dont forget to introduce yourself in the meet and greet forum

exploring data
first introduce the basic concepts of descriptive statistics talk about cases and variables and explain how you can order them in a socalled data matrix discuss various levels of measurement and show you how you can present your data by means of tables and graphs also introduce measures of central tendency like mode median and mean and dispersion like range interquartile range variance and standard deviation not only tell you how to interpret them also explain how you can compute them finally tell you more about zscores only discuss situations in which we analyze one single variable this is what we call univariate analysis in the next also introduce studies in which more variables are involved
cases variables and levels of measurement data matrix and frequency table graphs and shapes of distributions mode median and mean range interquartile range and box plot variance and standard deviation zscores example

correlation and regression
second look at bivariate analyses studies with two variables first introduce the concept of correlation investigate contingency tables when it comes to categorical variables and scatterplots regarding quantitative variables also how to understand and compute one of the most frequently used measures of correlation pearsons r in the next part of the introduce the method of ols regression analysis explain how you or the computer can find the regression line and how you can describe this line by means of an equation show you that you can assess how the regression line fits your data by means of the socalled rsquared we conclude the with a discussion of why you should always be very careful when interpreting the results of a regression analysis
crosstabs and scatterplots pearsons r regression finding the line regression describing the line regression how good is the line correlation is not causation example contingency table example pearsons r and regression

probability
this introduces concepts from probability theory and the rules for calculating with probabilities this is not only useful for answering various kinds of applied statistical questions but also to understand the statistical analyses that will be introduced in subsequent we start by describing randomness and explain how random events surround us next we provide an intuitive definition of probability through an example and relate this to the concepts of events sample space and random trials a graphical tool to understand these concepts is introduced here as the treediagramthereafter a number of concepts from set theory are explained and related to probability calculations here the relation is made to treediagrams again as as contingency tables we end with a lesson where conditional probabilities independence and bayes rule are explained all in all this is quite a theoretical on a topic that is not always easy to grasp thats why we have included as many intuitive examples as possible
randomness probability sample space event probability of event and tree diagram quantifying probabilities with tree diagram basic settheoretic concepts practice with sets union joint and marginal probabilities conditional probability independence between random events more conditional probability decision trees and bayes law

probability distributions
probability distributions form the core of many statistical calculations they are used as mathematical models to represent some random phenomenon and subsequently answer statistical questions about that phenomenon this starts by explaining the basic properties of a probability distribution highlighting how it quantifies a random variable and also pointing out how it differs between discrete and continuous random variables subsequently the cumulative probability distribution is introduced and its properties and usage are explained as in a next lecture it is shown how a random variable with its associated probability distribution can be characterized by statistics like a mean and variance just like observational data the effects of changing random variables by multiplication or addition on these statistics are explained as wellthe lecture thereafter introduces the normal distribution starting by explaining its functional form and some general properties next the basic usage of the normal distribution to calculate probabilities is explained and in a final lecture the binomial distribution an important probability distribution for discrete data is introduced and further explained by the end of this you have covered quite some ground and have a solid basis to answer the most frequently encountered statistical questions importantly the fundamental knowledge about probability distributions that is presented here will also provide a solid basis to about inferential statistics in the next
random variables and probability distributions cumulative probability distributions the mean of a random variable variance of a random variable functional form of the normal distribution the normal distribution probability calculations the standard normal distribution the binomial distribution

sampling distributions
methods for summarizing sample data are called descriptive statistics however in most studies were not interested in samples but in underlying populations if we employ data obtained from a sample to draw conclusions about a wider population we are using methods of inferential statistics it is therefore of essential importance that you know how you should draw samples pay attention to good sampling methods as as some poor practices to draw conclusions about the population a sample is from researchers make use of a probability distribution that is very important in the world of statistics the sampling distribution discuss sampling distributions in great detail and compare them to data distributions and population distributions look at the sampling distribution of the sample mean and the sampling distribution of the sample proportion
sample and population sampling the sampling distribution the central limit theorem three distributions sampling distribution proportion example

confidence intervals
we can distinguish two types of statistical inference methods we can estimate population parameters and test hypotheses about these parameters talk about the first type of inferential statistics estimation by means of a confidence interval a confidence interval is a range of numbers which most likely contains the actual population value the probability that the interval actually contains the population value is what we call the confidence level show you how you can construct confidence intervals for means and proportions and how you should interpret them also pay attention to how you can decide how large your sample size should be
statistical inference ci for mean with known population sd ci for mean with unknown population sd ci for proportion confidence levels choosing the sample size example

significance tests
talk about statistical hypotheses they form the main ingredients of the method of significance testing an hypothesis is nothing more than an expectation about a population when we conduct a significance test we use just like when we construct a confidence interval sample data to draw inferences about population parameters the significance test is therefore also a method of inferential statistics show that each significance test is based on two hypotheses the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis when you do a significance test you assume that the null hypothesis is true unless your data provide strong evidence against it show you how you can conduct a significance test about a mean and how you can conduct a test about a proportion also demonstrate that significance tests and confidence intervals are closely related we conclude the by arguing that you can make right and wrong decisions while doing a test wrong decisions are referred to as type i and type ii errors
hypotheses test about proportion test about mean stepbystep plan significance test and confidence interval type i and type ii errors example

exam time
this is the final where you can apply everything youve learned until now in the final exam please note that you can only take the final exam once a month so make sure you are fully prepared to take the test please follow the honor code and do not communicate or confer with others while taking this exam good luck
