intermediate postgresql
this covers a wide range of sql techniques beyond basic crud create read update and delete operations in postgresql the specifics of aggregation transactions reading and parsing csv files and inserting data into a database also take a look at how postgresql handles and indexes text dataspecifically students will do that alter table schemas create stored procedures construct advanced queries explore sorting and grouping query data and techniques for working with text in databases including regular expressions

sql techniques
first be introduced to the and look at sql commands for editing columns and tables in a postgresql database to create stored procedures and also utilize the select distinct command

json and natural language processing in postgresql
within this about how postgresql creates and uses inverted indexes for json and natural language content we will use various sources of data for our databases including access to an online api and spidering its data and storing the data in a json column in postgresql students will explore how fulltext inverted indexes are structured students will build their own inverted indexes and then make use of postgresql builtin capabilities to support fulltext indexes

natural language

database design and basic sql in postgresql
more about the historical design of databases and the use of sql in the postgresql environment using sql techniques and common commands insert into where order by on delete cascade etc will enable you to create tables column types and define the schema of your data in postgresql about data modeling and how to represent onetomany and manytomany relationships in postgresql students will do handson creating tables inserting data designing data models creating relational structures and inserting and querying relational data in tables

introduction to sql
first hear more about the goals of this about the people and organizations instrumental to building the sql standard to differentiate between relational databases and flat files and utilize psql and sql commands to create read update and delete tables in a postgresql database

database architecture scale and nosql with elasticsearch
final explore database architecture postgresql and various scalable deployment configurations see how postgresql implements basic crud operations and indexes and review how transactions and the acid atomicity consistency isolation durability requirements are implemented to use elasticsearch nosql which is a common nosql database and a supplement to a relational database to highspeed search and indexing we will examine elasticsearch as an example of a basestyle basic availability soft state eventual consistency database approach as well as compare and contrast the advantages and challenges associated with acid and base databases

scaling databases
first well introduce you to the topics covered including the comparison between sql and nosql and scaling relational databases
