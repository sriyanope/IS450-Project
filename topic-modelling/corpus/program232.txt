what is design thinking
welcome to the were excited youre here we will begin by unpacking what we mean by design thinking and why it is more effective than traditional methods when the goal is innovation by looking at the case history of the good kitchen a denmark for providing meals for the elderly we will explore how the mindset and practice of the innovation team that partnered with innovation consultant hatch bloom enabled them to achieve innovation and growth well also examine what kinds of challenges are bestsuited for design thinking and about the visualization tool which helps bring ideas to life by the end of this have a better understanding of what we mean by design thinking when to use it and how to use the visualization tool
introduction to design thinking what is design thinking hear from the experts the good kitchen story business model innovation challenges bestsuited for design thinking visualization tool

preparing your mind for innovation
design thinking is not only about process and tools it is about people as well about you as a design thinker and about the people you want to create value for and with and so before we jump into the process of using design thinking to generate and test ideas we want to first focus on your mindset and look at whether your mind is prepared to both see and act on when it shows up in your world we will examine this issue by looking at the stories of two very capable managers george and geoff and how their differing mindsets affect their ability to lead innovation and growth well also about the value of the storytelling tool by the end of this have a better understanding of a mind prepared to see and take action when arises and how to use the storytelling tool
the physics of innovation the story of george geoff how prepared is your mind storytelling tool

idea generation
now we will dive deeper into the design thinking process looking at how we can use it to generate better ideas we will look at the story of an entrepreneur chris cartter and his startup meyouhealth as they worked with boston design firm essential design to understand the kind of that social networking might hold for helping us to improve our health examining what already exists is the first step in the design thinking process as part of assessing what is designers follow the customer home and explore the problems they are trying to solve in life versus their product use once they have thoroughly explored and looked for patterns designers look toward the future and ask what if this is the creative part of the process but it also requires a disciplined approach by the end of this understand how to use design thinking to generate innovative ideas how to apply the what is and what if questions and how to use the mind mapping tool
the idea generation process the meyouhealth story part i what is the meyouhealth story part ii what if mind mapping tool

what wows what works the ibm story launch tool reviewing our lessons strategic

final
this hosts materials related to your final for the the requires selecting one of the design thinking tools presented in the writing a reflection and completing three peer reviews to successfully complete the you must complete and pass the final
