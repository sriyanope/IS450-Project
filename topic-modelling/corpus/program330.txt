six sigma yellow belt
this is for you if you are looking to more about six sigma or refresh your knowledge of the basic components of six sigma and lean six sigma are widely sought by employers both nationally and internationally these have been proven to help improve business processes performance and quality assurance
proven principles and tools specific to six sigma and lean
this is a sequential linear designed that covers the introductory level content at the yellow belt level of six sigma and lean yellow belt knowledge is needed before advancing to green belt which is a second offered here on coursera by the usg green belt knowledge is needed before moving to a black belt
the proper sequence of this is
six sigma fundamentals
six sigma tools for define and measure
six sigma tools for analyze
six sigma tools for improve and control
at the end of six sigma tools for improve and control there is a peerreviewed capstone project successful completion of this project is necessary for full completion of this
it should be noted that completing either the yellow belt or green belt specializations does not give the learner accreditation in six sigma however successful completion will assist in better preparation for such accreditation testing

upon completion of this learners will have created a project charter project team charter data collection plan process map along with null and alternative hypotheses problem statement business case goal statement process and scope and timeline all these will be created using the six sigma principles and tools they learned
