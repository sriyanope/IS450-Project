ai in healthcare
artificial intelligence ai has transformed industries around the world and has the potential to radically alter the field of healthcare imagine being able to analyze data on patient visits to the clinic medications prescribed lab tests and procedures performed as as data outside the health system such as social media purchases made using credit cards census records internet search activity logs that contain valuable health information and get a sense of how ai could transform patient care and diagnoses
discuss the current and future applications of ai in healthcare with the goal of learning to bring ai technologies into the clinic safely and ethically
this is designed for both healthcare providers and computer science professionals offering insights to facilitate collaboration between the disciplines
cme accreditation
the stanford university school of medicine is accredited by the accreditation council for continuing medical education accme to provide continuing medical education for physicians view the full cme accreditation information on the individual faq page

the final will consist of a capstone project that will take you on a guided tour exploring all the concepts we have covered in the different classes this will be a handson following a patients journey from the lens of the data using a unique dataset created for this specializationwe will review how the different choices you make such as those around feature construction the data types to use how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline affect the care that would be recommended by the model

introduction to healthcare
solving the problems and challenges within the us healthcare system requires a deep understanding of how the system works successful solutions and strategies must take into account the realities of the current system
this explores the fundamentals of the us healthcare system it will introduce the principal institutions and participants in healthcare systems explain what they do and discuss the interactions between them the will cover physician practices hospitals pharmaceuticals and insurance and financing arrangements also discuss the challenges of healthcare cost management quality of care and access to care while the focuses on the us healthcare system also refer to healthcare systems in other developed countries in support of improving patient care stanford medicine is jointly accredited by the accreditation council for continuing medical education accme the accreditation council for pharmacy education acpe and the american nurses credentialing center ancc to provide continuing education for the healthcare team visit the faqs below for important information regarding date of the original release and expiration date

ai in healthcare capstone
this capstone project takes you on a guided tour exploring all the concepts we have covered in the different classes up till now we have organized this around the journey of a patient who develops some respiratory symptoms and given the concerns around covid seeks care with a primary care provider follow the patients journey from the lens of the data that are created at each encounter which will bring us to a unique deidentified dataset created specially for this the data set spans ehr as as image data and using this dataset build models that enable riskstratification decisions for our patient review how the different choices you make such as those around feature construction the data types to use how the model evaluation is set up and how you handle the patient timeline affect the care that would be recommended by the model during this exploration also discuss the regulatory as as ethical issues that come up as we attempt to use ai to help us make better care decisions for our patient this will be a handson in the day of a medical data miner
