motivation stress and character change
this weeks materials cover motivation stress and character changevitally important topics for us as teachers about the importance of surprise in learningpart of what can make good teaching both surprising and rewarding also discover why we like to say that curiosity is queen and why being taken by surprise can be a very good thing when it comes to learning also about the drama kingthat is the amygdalawhich can underpin some of our subconscious biases and begin setting the stage to understand why cramming is so effective at least for short periods of time neuroscience is uncovering new insights about motivation this brings us to a seemingly different areaunreachable unteachable students who can tell you exactly what you want to hear without any internal motivation for change no matter what you may do to try to motivate them perhaps surprisinglybullying isnt just a problem for studentsit can actually be a problem amongst teachers themselves with some of the best teachers bearing the brunt of the bullying behavior but guess whatsometimes our best approach to help students sail successfully through stressful situations in life is to simply do what we teachers are born to doteach with passion and with heart all this and more weeks
introduction to two building community and habits of learning a hook you didnt even see coming learning motivation and dopamine dont say boostress and the power of the amygdala digging deeper into motivation the disparity between intellect and character good intentions and systemic problems a deeper look at efforts to eradicate bullying and other harmful behavior the importance of forgetting in learning life and overcoming stress

how to reach and teach both procedural and declarative pathways
how the brain decides whether to make some mental or physical task conscious or nonconsciousit all depends on how often we do it also be sneaking in through both the front and back doors of the brains different learning systems of both declarative and procedural ways of learning can have advantages and drawbacks but as see having information deposited in procedural sets of links can be like having a nicely wrapped package of movements or thoughts that a students working memory can automatically grab onto instead of having to think through each tiny movement or thought individually this can not only speed students learningit can even make classroom management easier using the magic of the procedural system your classroom can run like a welloiled machine seemingly without you doing anything
learning without knowing you know revisiting the procedural system compression is the name of the game front doors and back doorsdiving deeper into the procedural system understanding the differences between declarative and procedural learning how to reach and teach both procedural and declarative pathways habits in the classroom be mindful of what you want your students to do mindlessly practical examples of mindfully mindless behaviors part practical examples of mindfully mindless behaviors part

intellectual humility critical thinking and bias
is full of surprises as we dig deeper into the advantages and disadvantages of faster and slower types of learning who knew that those who struggle with their learningour hikerscan actually be more accurate with what they for them it can be easier to flexibly accept and change their minds when the data shows they are wrong on the other hand our race cars who can faster and remember better can also find it difficult to accept when theyre wrong and all this relates in a very deep way as see with our ability to think critically join us as we explore all these ideas and more weeks and dont forget theres plenty of optional extra info in the
race cars hikers and intellectual humility introduction to critical thinking from a neuroscientific perspective why critical thinking isnt easy how difficult it can be to think different as a teacher biases and fixed mindsets in research the challenge of fixed mindsets in expert educators thinking consciously and critically about and in teams using a case study to teach students how to resolve group dysfunction

neurodiversity student groups and charting your to the finish line
syndromes such as dyslexia or attention deficit disorder can sometimes exert subtle effects that can make learning more difficult even though no diagnosis has been made other times as with famed director steven spielberg and his dyslexia a students learning challenges can simply escape detection altogether for teachers of these students the best approach is to nurture these students ways of learning rather than forcing them to like the majority of other students surprisingly often this involves teaching more toward the procedural system for some students and more toward the declarative system for others all of this means that careful planning of your lessons is in order what do we mean by careful planning thats the subject of our final videoswell give you a template and insights to help guide your activities and allow you to soar in your teaching

uncommon sense teaching teaching online
in uncommon sense teaching teaching online wed like to help you to move toward fresh approaches to online teaching that build on the latest insights from scientific research use insights from moviemakingnot to mention from odd visual tricks in barbs kitchento see how students both independently and together we all know for example that social learning is valuable in helping students grapple with tough concepts as as in making learning more fun but if you understand what is happening in the brain during social learning you can also understand why certain approaches commonly used in online learning such as discussion forums can sometimes pose a challenge as see we can use insights from neuroscience not only to motivate our students but to help them change their very identity
our is designed for university professors vocational instructors k teachers coaches business trainers parents and in fact anyone who is trying to teach concepts or online were not just talking about traditional academic materialsif youve ever considered teaching a on udemy putting up a series on youtube or launching your own educational blog this is also for you an essential and exciting point is that students can even better online than they can in the traditional facetoface classroom thats whether youre teaching synchronouslythat is live via a platform like zoom
or youre teaching asynchronouslythat is any timeby having and other teaching materials accessible to students whenever they want you can take this independently from the other two uncommon sense teaching courses specializationsome of the neuroscience and cognitivepsychologybased insights mention here in simple ways are explored more deeply in those other courses so feel free to take the other two courses in the in conjunction with or after this if youve already taken the other two courses find that this reviews and extends the practical insights from neuroscience youve already received in unexpected new directions and find even deeper insights we havent covered before in teaching online be joining a trio of experienced online instructors who have taught millions in some of the worlds most popular online courses one of our deepest goals for this is to help you to teach others to improve their ability to reach and teach students weve loaded the animations and visuals weve developed for this online in powerpoints licensed under creative commons in the assets under the as as in the resources section you can rework these powerpoints as you wish to reteach this material to your colleagues and students your sharing and resharing of this material is one of the best things you can do to help us all move teaching and learning forward to a visionary future you are the foundationchildren adults and society as a whole can leap ahead because of your desire to and spread these new ideas

schemas motivation and teaching online
a major challenge in teachingespecially teaching onlineis how to motivate your students introduce the concept of schemasthose frameworks in longterm memory that help form our very identities as see increasing our motivation can involve changing our identitiesa process that good online teaching can spur what is good online teaching its teaching that avoids checkbox approaches that seem to satisfy all the requirements but in reality produce poor online learning for students there are many paths past these challengesdive into the details with us weeks
introduction to teaching online schemas and the expertise reversal effect lowstakes onboarding quizzes and avoiding the horrors of goodharts law create a quick walkthrough of your schemas of identity can provide motivationor demotivation the imposter syndrome in online teaching wrapup

popcorn time lessons from the neuroscience of movie watching
habits form a surprisingly important role in our online teaching this means we can of simple practices for good online teachingyet ignore them when it comes time to actually implement them but as we explore there are ways around this challenge also explore how slightly different camera settings and angles lighting and above all sound quality can have a surprisingly beneficial effect on our students finally take a plunge into what movies can tell us about how to teach effectively online as discover theoretical techniques that can in traditional classrooms dont necessarily transfer to the online world
on and off camera habits and the declarativeprocedural learning systems why knowing and doing are not the same thing lights camera actionoops youre ready for your closeupwait too close breaking bad habits when it comes to teaching onlineand in everyday life talk to the handthe power of gesture to help form mental models diving deeper into mental models catching continuity errors at the movieshow mental models arise predicting effective online strategiesinsight from mental models more how long should online be more insight from mental models wrapup

retrieval spaced repetition in online learning
todays online learners have no time to waste how can you ensure that students as deeply and as possible in minimal time thats the focus of this weeks dive into specific popular applications that can enhance students ability to retain the materialand also help you see at a glance how your students are understanding what you are teaching while you are teaching our octopus and flocks of birds will also be at hand as metaphors that can help us understand in surprising ways how key concepts come together in the brain as see online teaching can give us a great platform to encapsulate key concepts by turning them into tight events that are easier to retrieve
todays online learners have no time to waste what do retrieval practice and spaced repetition have to do with mental models or good online teaching skirting around the complexity of working memory mental models retrieval practice helps solidify both simple and complex events in schemas cognitive loadif the event is too complicated watch out how to use retrieval practice apps to encourage collaboration how to use a specific retrieval practice app idorecall in your coursera courses how to solicit live monitored retrieval practice from every student in a class simultaneously pear deck working memory nonnative speakers and barbs personal with retrieval practice wrapup

preparing now and for the future through great online teaching
one of the great features of the online environment is that it allows you to use simple attentional tricks that are virtually impossible to do in real life and your friendly moving image on the screen can provide for a social partnership that becomes very realand very encouragingfor students this can happen even when you have classes so large that you dont have the ability to interact individually with your students but perhaps surprisingly attention isnt always importantcreativity thrives when attention wanders there are specific tricks in the online environment to encourage this learning also thrives when students can interact with one anothernot only because of the exchange of mental models and of schemas but also due to interaction with familiar faces who share eye gaze as see this gives us important insights related to online discussion forums finally how learning itself changes the brain in therapeutic uplifting ways this means online teaching can provide resilience for societies through good times and bad all this and more in our final of teaching online
focused versus diffuse thinking attentionhow to get it and why you want to sometimes lose it why editing your own can be a good idea its good to leave them hanging the value of suspense humor does not mean being a comedian creating a social partnership teleprompters and giant frogs the paradox of selffocus mental model and schema sharing jolts of joy the challenge of discussion forums wrapup learning as therapyand as preparation for the future

active learning for all
this weeks material covers the deepest essence of how we learnwhich can provide surprisingly helpful and practical insights for our teaching when students are learning ideas captured in students working memories are sent to longterm memory in the neocortex one of our biggest challenges in learning is the diversity in size of learners working memorythat temporary holding place for new ideas we are thinking about we three instructors model these differences in working memory capacity with terry having high capacity barb low capacity and beth variable depending on the material some people can hold more information in working memorythese racecar learners might more quickly but what they can go by in a blurthey can jump to conclusions and find it difficult to correct themselves when they make errors hiker learners with lesser capacity working memory may more slowly but they can more deeply and sometimes more creatively as a consequence they can also find it easier to be flexible and change their thinking when they are wrong what this all means is that the different sizes of working memory can have their advantages and disadvantages scaffolded instruction is a key to being more inclusive so we can reach all of our learners not just the few who are easy to teach also take a fresh view of active learningthose words as discover do not always mean what you think they mean
the essence of how we it link it how students fool themselves into thinking theyre learning teaching inclusivelythe importance of working memory capacity tricks for expanding working memory hintit involves longterm memory optional how to integrate a flashcard retrieval practice system into this inclusivity differentiation and scaffolding practical insights related to working memory what is active learning optional interview with dr cory steiner about his schools conversion to mastery learning

helping the brain build better links for learning
dive into the brains two major superhighways of learning the declarative pathway wends its way through the hippocampus and onto the neocortex this pathway is for new information students are trying to figure out or a tiny fun metaphorical choir will help you better understand how the hippocampus a glib character named hip the neocortex a capacious singer named neo and working memory the conductor all interact to help students declaratively and how beth used this type of learning along with the underlying allimportant consolidation processesto help her recover her ability to read the words she can now speak so eloquently the more mysterious procedural pathway involves information or activities that we use or do so often that we dont want to have to waste cognitive resources in having to think about them think that drill means kill think againwe teachers ignore the value of the procedural pathway at our peril as discover smartly done drill leads to also cover important issues related to lack of focus including task switching dual tasking and continuous partial attention but unrelenting focus isnt always the answeras see there are tricks to help students get around the cognitive fixation that can cause them so many problems on tests finally show how using a neural approach to understanding the effects of your teaching can also help you to understand the value of seemingly unrelated ideas and approaches like physical exercise and of metaphor when it learning its going to be a fun actionpacked
introduction to the declarative learning system hip hip hooray i do declare theres a hip way to get info into longterm memory concussion dealt me a knockout blowthe value of consolidation the value of metaphor introduction to procedural learning drill to the power of exercise the vital importance of focus helping the brain build better links for learning

practice passion and procrastination
we dive into one of students most common issues with their studiesprocrastination a common tool for business the pomodoro technique turns out to be also useful to help students of all ages focus their meditation this is because the pomodoro technique makes masterful use of the brains focusing and relaxing modes of thinking judicious focusing and relaxing of ones thoughts is also a great way to figure out difficult or frustrating concepts or problems but when it comes to studying its important not only to focus and relax but also to step back and look at the big picture of where the studies are headed is the common advice for students to follow your passion always the best advice and there are other bigger picture issues related to learning to help ensure our students approach their studies projects and tests with the best possible attitude and preparation
focused and diffuse modes procrastination and the pomodoro technique diving deeper into procrastination dont just follow your passionsbroaden them practicethe key to remarkable changes motivation habit and salt rubrics helping students succeed in testtaking ensuring equity fairness and inclusion in your testing

how human brains evolvedand why this matters for your teaching
do children differently than adults yes they do and this weeks insights show us how our brains change as we mature these changes mean that certain approaches that great for our youngest students arent necessarily appropriate for middle and high school students looking at learning from an evolutionary perspective helps us to understand why some types of learning are natural and easy while other forms can be far more difficult what are some of the best ways to tackle teaching the moredifficulttolearn material thats what this culminating of our first mooc in the uncommon sense teaching is all about
