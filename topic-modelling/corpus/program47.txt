earnings management
we are going to examine earnings management which is the practice of trying to intentionally bias financial statements to look better than they really should look beginning with an of earnings management cover means motive and how managers actually make their earnings look better their incentives for manipulating earnings and how they get away with it then investigate red flags for two different forms of revenue manipulation manipulating earnings through aggressive revenue recognition practices is the most common reason that companies get in trouble with government regulators for their accounting practices next discuss red flags for manipulating earnings through aggressive expense recognition practices which is the second most common reason that companies get in trouble for their accounting practices by the end of this know how to spot earnings management and get a more accurate picture of earnings so that be able to catch some bad guys in finance reporting
earnings management of earnings management revenue recognition red flags revenue before cash collection revenue recognition red flags revenue after cash collection expense recognition red flags capitalizing vs expensing expense recognition red flags reserve accounts and writeoffs

big data and prediction models
use big data approaches to try to detect earnings management specifically were going to use prediction models to try to predict how the financial statements would look if there were no manipulation by the manager first look at discretionary accruals models which try to model the noncash portion of earnings or accruals where managers are making estimates to calculate revenues or expenses next talk about discretionary expenditure models which try to model the cash portion of earnings then look at fraud prediction models which try to directly predict what types of companies are likely to commit frauds finally explore something called benfords law which examines the frequency with which certain numbers appear if certain numbers appear more often than dictated by benfords law its an indication that the financial statements were potentially manipulated these models represent the state of the art right now and are what academics use to try to detect and predict earnings management by the end of this have a very strong tool kit that will help you try to detect financial statements that may have been manipulated by managers
discretionary accruals model discretionary accruals cases discretionary expenditures models discretionary expenditures refinements and cases fraud prediction models benfords law

linking nonfinancial metrics to financial performance
linking nonfinancial metrics to financial performance is one of the most important things we do as managers and also one of the most difficult we need to forecast future financial performance but we have to take nonfinancial actions to influence it and we must be able to accurately predict the ultimate impact on financial performance of improving nonfinancial dimensions examine how to uncover which nonfinancial performance measures predict financial results through asking fundamental questions such as of the hundreds of nonfinancial measures which are the key drivers of financial success how do you rank or weight nonfinancial measures which dont share a common denominator what performance targets are desirable finally look at some comprehensive examples of how companies have used accounting analytics to show how investments in nonfinancial dimensions pay off in the future and finish with some important organizational issues that commonly arise using these models by the end of this know how predictive analytics can be used to determine what you should be measuring how to weight very very different performance measures when trying to analyze potential financial results how to make tradeoffs between shortterm and longterm objectives and how to set performance targets for optimal financial performance
introduction connecting numbers to nonfinancial performance measures linking nonfinancial metrics to financial performance steps to linking nonfinancial metrics to financial performance setting targets comprehensive examples incorporating analysis results in financial models using analytics to choose action plans organizational issues

the business analytics capstone project gives you the to apply what youve learned about how to make datadriven decisions to a real business challenge faced by global technology companies like yahoo google and facebook at the end of this capstone be able to ask the right questions of the data and know how to use data effectively to address business challenges of your own understand how cuttingedge businesses use data to optimize marketing maximize revenue make operations efficient and make hiring and management decisions so that you can apply these strategies to your own company or business designed with yahoo to give you invaluable in evaluating and creating datadriven decisions the business analytics capstone project provides the chance for you to devise a plan of action for optimizing data itself to provide key insights and analysis and to describe the interaction between key financial and nonfinancial indicators once you complete your analysis be better prepared to make better datadriven business decisions of your own

capstone project topic the problem of adblocking
the business analytics was designed to help you how to think about using data in making big and small business decisions capstone project be asked to create a strategy for a fictional digital search engine and content provider goyaface inc often abbreviated as gyf the strategy will be used in responding to the increasing popularity and availability of adblocking software which could have significant negative repercussions for gyfs business you are to assume the role of the leader of the digital advertising tactics and action data team at gyf which has been assigned the job of formulating gyfs strategy in responding to the threat of adblocking your task is to develop a strategy that will be recommended to gyfs senior leadership using what youve learned about business analytics i create a detailed problem statement focusing on gyfs adbuying customers ii develop a strategy iii describe the anticipated effects of the strategy and iv form a plan for measuring the effects of your strategy then put these four pieces together into a final project first please read the full of the project in the project link below and then look at the background information about adblockers and the gyf company profile link in the content for when you are ready to begin the first please move on to defining the problem

defining the problem
in define the problem adblockers poses for gyf gyf is intended to be a composite of leading internet platform and content providers who derive substantial revenues from mobile advertising like google yahoo and facebook so you should frame your research around the realworld problems these companies have faced and are facing defining the problem thoroughly will have a direct impact on how successful your strategy will be received by your peers the more deeply you consider the effects of adblockers on the companies that buy advertising space from gyf the more appropriate your overall strategy is likely to be please use the resources below to find out more about the problem and then create your problem statement and submit it for peer review below you can and should draw from all of the business analytics courses but your problem statement should focus on how adblockers might adversely affect gyfs relationship with the companies that pay gyf to place advertisements on gyfs mobile applications and content you should consider the issue of causality in your problem statement weve included some lectures from the underlying courses to refresh you on that topci and you are strongly encouraged to complete and include a response to application exercise see link below as part of your problem statement
