networks definition and why we study them network definition and vocabulary node and edge attributes bipartite graphs ta demonstration loading graphs in networkx

network connectivity
in two how to analyze the connectivity of a network based on measures of distance reachability and redundancy of paths between nodes in the practice using networkx to compute measures of connectivity of a network of email communication among the employees of a midsize manufacturing company
clustering coefficient distance measures connected components network robustness ta demonstration simple network visualizations in networkx

influence measures and network centralization
in three explore ways of measuring the importance or centrality of a node in a network using measures such as degree closeness and betweenness centrality page rank and hubs and authorities about the assumptions each measure makes the algorithms we can use to compute them and the different functions available on networkx to measure centrality in the practice choosing the most appropriate centrality measure on a realworld setting
degree and closeness centrality betweenness centrality basic page rank scaled page rank hubs and authorities centrality examples

network evolution
in four explore the evolution of networks over time including the different models that generate networks with realistic features such as the preferential attachment model and small world networks also explore the link prediction problem where useful features that can predict whether a pair of disconnected nodes will be connected in the future in the be challenged to identify which model generated a given network additionally have the to combine different concepts of the by predicting the salary position and future connections of the employees of a company using their logs of email exchanges

charting fundamentals
explore charting fundamentals for this weeks to implement a new visualization technique based on academic research this is flexible and you can address it using a variety of difficulties from an easy static image to an interactive chart where users can set ranges of values to be used
subplots histograms box plots heatmaps animation widget demonstration

applied visualizations
then everything starts to come together your final is entitled becoming a data scientist this requires that you identify at least two publicly accessible datasets from the same region that are consistent across a meaningful dimension state a research question that can be answered using these data sets and then create a visual using matplotlib that addresses your stated research question then be asked to justify how your visual addresses your research question
