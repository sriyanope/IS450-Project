introduction to logic and critical thinking
by taking introduction to logic and critical thinking improve your ability to identify analyze and evaluate arguments by other people including politicians used car salesmen and teachers and also to construct arguments of your own in order to convince others and to help you decide what to believe or do this introduces general standards of good reasoning and offers tools to improve your critical thinking these will help you determine when an argument is being given what its crucial parts are and what it assumes implicitly also how to apply deductive and inductive standards for assessing arguments and how to detect and avoid fallacies


this includes four courses and an optional final project in the final project construct your own argument on any topic that interests you develop a thesis statement and write an argument of words to support your thesis

welcome to the
welcome to think again how to reason inductively this is the third in the introduction to logic and critical thinking based on our original coursera titled think again how to reason and argue we are excited that you are taking this and we hope that take all four courses in the series because there is a great deal of important material to in the series as a whole you how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning these important will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life the first part of this introduces the series and the it also clarifies some peculiarities you may find with this we encourage you to watch the introduction to the first as it will help you more from the materials that come later

inductive arguments
this begins by distinguishing inductive arguments from deductive arguments then we discuss four common forms of inductive argument generalizations from samples such as in political polls applications of generalizations to particular cases such as in predicting weather on a certain day inferences to the best explanation such as in using evidence to determine who committed a crime and arguments from analogy such as in identifying the use of one archaeological artifact by comparing it to other artifacts expose the most common mistakes in these kinds of reasoning some of the lectures this are a bit experimental and perhaps weird as see we hope that you enjoy them if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these kinds of inductive arguments we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapters and
what is induction generalizations from samples when are generalizations strong applying generalizations another example of applying generalizations optional inference to the best explanation which explanation is best a student example of inference to the best explanation arguments from analogy

causal reasoning
this will focus on how to decide what causes what students will how to distinguish necessary conditions from sufficient conditions and how to use data to test hypotheses about what is and what is not a necessary condition or a sufficient condition then distinguish causation from correlation or concomitant variation and explain the fallacy of post hoc ergo propter hoc it is sad that some diners had to die to make this lesson possible as seeif you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapter
causal reasoning negative sufficient condition tests positive sufficient condition tests negative necessary condition tests positive necessary condition tests complex conditions correlation versus causation causal fallacies a student example causal reasoning about chocolate

chance and choice
this will cover chance and choicein other words probability and decision making probability is useful for measuring the strength of inductive arguments and also for deciding what to believe and what to do about the nature and kinds of probability along with four simple rules for calculating probabilities an optional honors lecture will then explain bayes theorem and the common mistake of overlooking the base rate next use probabilities to evaluate decisions by figuring their expected financial value and contrasting financial value with overall value if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapters and
why probability matters what is probability negation conjunction disjunction series bayes theorem optional expected financial value expected overall value the sausage argument a student argument about decision making

catchup and final quiz
this gives you time to catch up and review because we realize that the previous include a great deal of challenging material it will also be provide enough time to take the final quiz as often as you want with different questions each time we explain the answers in each exam so that you can more and do better when you try the exam again you may take the quiz as many times as you want in order to more and do better with different questions each time be able to retake the quiz three times every eight hours you might not need to take more than one version of the exam if you do enough on your first try that is up to you however many versions you take we hope that all of the exams will provide additional learning

think again i how to understand arguments
what an argument is the definition of argument will enable you to identify when speakers are giving arguments and when they are not next how to break an argument into its essential parts how to put them in order to reveal their connections and how to fill in gaps in an argument by adding suppressed premises by the end of this be better able to understand and appreciate arguments that you and other people present
suggested students who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult understanding arguments an introduction to informal logic ninth edition concise chapters by walter sinnottarmstrong and robert fogelin format each will be divided into multiple segments that can be viewed separately or in groups there will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment to check comprehension and a longer graded quiz at the end of the

welcome to the
welcome to our introduction to logic and critical thinking based on our coursera think again how to reason and argue this coursethink again how to understand arguments is the first in a series of four courses we are excited that you are taking this and we hope that stick around for all four courses in the series because there is a great deal of important material to in the series as a whole how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning these important will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life also have plenty of fun the first part of this introduces the and the it also clarifies some peculiarities you may find with this we encourage you to watch the introduction to the first as it will help you more from the materials that come later

how to spot an argument
material teach you how to identify arguments as opposed to abuse define what an argument is distinguish various purposes for which arguments are given including persuasion justification and explanation and discuss the material out of which arguments are made language the last three lectures this are optional but they are recommended for advanced students learning by the end of this material be able to define what an argument ispull arguments out of larger texts distinguish various purposes of arguments optional reading if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapters
why arguments matter what is an argument what are arguments used for justification strong arguments dont always persuade everyone what else are arguments used for explanation what are arguments made of language meaning linguistic acts speech acts conversational acts

how to untangle an argument
this material will focus on the special language in which arguments are formulated investigate the functions of particular words including premise and conclusion markers plus assuring guarding discounting and evaluative terms identifying these words will enable students to separate arguments from the irrelevant verbiage that surrounds it and then to break the argument into parts and to identify what each part of an argument is doing the lectures end with a detailed example that uses these tools to closely analyze an oped from a newspaper learning by the end of this material be able to understand three levels of meaning identify argument markers optional reading if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapters
argument markers standard form a problem for arguments assuring guarding discounting evaluation close analysis part i close analysis part ii more close analysis

how to reconstruct an argument
this material will teach you how to organize the parts of an argument in order to show how they fit into a structure of reasoning the goal is to make the argument look as good as possible so that you can from it we through the main steps of reconstruction including putting the premises and conclusion into a standard form clarifying the premises and breaking them into parts arranging the argument into stages or subarguments adding suppressed premises where needed to make the argument valid and assessing the argument for soundness the lectures begin by defining the crucial notions of validity soundness and standard form also to diagram alternative argument structures including linear branching and joint structures learning by the end of this material be able to label assuring guarding discounting and evaluative terms determine whether an argument is valid or sound complete arguments by adding suppressed premises reconstruct arguments by and series of arguments and classify argument structures optional reading if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapter
validity soundness get down to basics sharpen edges organize parts a student example a debate about smartphones in class fill in gaps conclude an example of reconstruction part i an example of reconstruction part ii an example of reconstruction part iii

think again iv how to avoid fallacies
we encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look politicians salespeople and children commonly use fallacies in order to get you to think whatever they want you to think its important to to recognize fallacies so that you can avoid being fooled by them its also important to about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious arguments yourself this will show you how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that lead people astray
about fallacies fallacies are arguments that suffer from one or more common but avoidable defects equivocation circularity vagueness etc its important to about fallacies so that you can recognize them when you see them and not be fooled by them its also important to about fallacies so that you avoid making fallacious arguments yourself suggested students who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult understanding arguments an introduction to informal logic ninth edition concise chapters by walter sinnottarmstrong and robert fogelin format each will be divided into multiple segments that can be viewed separately or in groups there will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment to check comprehension and a longer graded quiz at the end of the

welcome to the
welcome to think again how to avoid fallacies this is the fourth in the introduction to logic and critical thinking based on our original coursera titled think again how to reason and argue we are excited that you are taking this and we hope that take all four courses in the series because there is a great deal of important material to in the series as a whole you how to analyze and evaluate arguments and how to avoid common mistakes in reasoning these important will be useful to you in deciding what to believe and what to do in all areas of your life we encounter fallacies almost everywhere we look politicians salespeople and children commonly use fallacies in order to get us to think what they want us to think think again how to avoid fallacies will show how to identify and avoid many of the fallacies that people use to get us to think the way they want us to think the first part of this introduces the series and the it also clarifies some peculiarities you may find with this we encourage you to watch the introduction to the first as it will help you more from the materials that come later

fallacies of unclarity
material describes two phenomena that are both common and useful in the languages that human beings speak but both of which give rise to the potential for fallacious reasoning a word or phrase is vague when its meaning is not precise and it is ambiguous when it has more than one meaning when we use vague or ambiguous phrases in our reasoning it is very easy for us to make a number of different kinds of fallacies this will teach you what these different kinds of fallacies are and give us some practice in spotting them so you can make sure to avoid them in the future if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of the fallacies that result from vagueness or ambiguity we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapters
introduction to fallacies argument from the heap vagueness conceptual slippery slopes fairness slippery slopes causal slippery slopes ambiguity semantic and syntactic ambiguity fallacies of equivocation

fallacies of relevance
this describes two of the most common fallacies that people make ad hominem fallacies and appeals to authority part of what makes these fallacies so common and so difficult to avoid is that many ad hominem arguments and many appeals to authority are actually not fallacies at all only some of them are and figuring out which of them are fallacies is more of an art than a science there is no simple recipe but there are some rules of thumb you can use we hope that the practice that you get will help you to improve your at distinguish the fallacious from the nonfallacious instances of ad hominem reasoning as as appeal to authority if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapter
fallacies of relevance and vacuity fallacies of relevance ad hominem silencers dismissers deniers appeals to authority amplifiers supporters affirmers appeals to popular opinion

fallacies of vacuity and circularity
now describe another common set of fallacies fallacies that occur when an argument makes no progress from its premises to its conclusion sometimes arguments make no progress because the conclusion is already contained in the premises sometimes arguments make no progress because the conclusion is presupposed by the premises and sometimes arguments make no progress because the premises dont make any claim at all even if they might sound like they do when you know how to identify such fallacies find that they are more common than you think if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapter
fallacies of vacuity circularity and begging the question selfsealers

refutation its varieties and pitfalls
this teach you various strategies for refuting a fallacious argument to refute an argument is to show that the argument is unsuccessful even if you are able to identify a fallacious argument as a fallacy you might still not be able to prove to others that it is a fallacy a variety of techniques for proving to others that the argument is a fallacy if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapter
refutation refutation by parallel reasoning false dichotomy reductio ad absurdum counterexamples attacking a straw man why walter should shave his head

catchup and final quiz
this gives you time to catch up and review because we realize that the previous include a great deal of challenging material it will also be provide enough time to take the final quiz as often as you want with different questions each time we explain the answers in each exam so that you can more and do better when you try the exam again you may take the quiz as many times as you want in order to more and do better with different questions each time be able to retake the quiz three times every eight hours you might not need to take more than one version of the exam if you do enough on your first try that is up to you however many versions you take we hope that all of the exams will provide additional learning

think again ii how to reason deductively
deductive arguments are supposed to be valid in the sense that the premises guarantee that the conclusion is true how to use truthtables and venn diagrams to represent the information contained in the premises and conclusion of an argument so that you can determine whether or not the argument is deductively valid
suggested students who want more detailed explanations or additional exercises or who want to explore these topics in more depth should consult understanding arguments an introduction to informal logic ninth edition concise chapters and by walter sinnottarmstrong and robert fogelin format each will be divided into multiple segments that can be viewed separately or in groups there will be short ungraded quizzes after each segment to check comprehension and a longer graded quiz at the end of the

welcome to the
welcome to think again how to reason deductively this is the second in the introduction to logic and critical thinking based on our original coursera titled think again how to reason and argue we are excited that you are taking this and we hope that stick around for all four courses in the series because there is a great deal of important material to learnin the series as a whole how to evaluate deductive arguments what is it for a deductive to be valid and how can you tell the difference between deductive arguments that are valid and those that arent answer these questions the first part of this introduces the series and the it also clarifies some peculiarities you may find with this we encourage you to watch the introduction to the first as it will help you more from the materials that come later

propositional logic and truth tables
this teach you how such phrases as and or if and not can to guarantee the validity or invalidity of the deductive arguments in which they occur it will also teach you to understand the functioning of these phrases using a device called a truthtable which shows how the truth or falsity of propositions that use these phrases depends upon the truth or falsity of the propositions contained within it we highly recommend that you practice the that by doing the puzzles at betapuzzlesonjaracom if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapter

categorical logic and syllogisms
this will teach you how such phrases as all some and none can to guarantee the validity or invalidity of the deductive arguments in which they occur it will also teach you to understand the functioning of these phrases using a device called a venn diagram which shows how the truth or falsity of propositions that use these phrases depends upon the truth or falsity of other propositions that use these phrases we highly recommend that you practice the that by doing the puzzles at httpphilgamesnetaappsuncedu if you want more examples or more detailed discussions of these topics we recommend understanding arguments ninth edition chapter
categorical logic categories and quantifiers how quantifiers modify categories immediate categorical inferences syllogisms categories individuals and language venn diagrams and validity other ways of expressing a e i or o propositions

representing information
teach you how to use the tools that youve learned about in the preceding in order to represent information information can be communicated in very different ways by means of different languages or signaling systems but no matter how that information is communicated it can be important to use that information in reasoning how to reason from information that is communicated directly by means of truthtables or venn diagrams
reasoning from venn diagrams or truth tables alone different ways of representing information

catchup and final quiz
