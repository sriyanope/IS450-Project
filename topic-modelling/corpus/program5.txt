ai for good
the ai for good showcases how ai can be part of the solution when it comes to addressing some of the worlds biggest challenges in areas like public health climate change and disaster management
in these courses from instructor robert monarch who has over years of building ai products in industry and working at the intersection of ai and public health and disaster management robert is also the author of humanintheloop machine learningopens in a new tab a book focused on humancentered ai applications
throughout the courses hear from experts working on ai for good initiatives aimed at addressing social and environmental issues by combining human and machine intelligence realworld datasets best practices around data privacy and ethical considerations develop the knowledge and fundamental to tackle your own ai for good projects
these courses were built in partnership with researchers at the microsoft ai for good labopens in a new tab who offered their subject matter expertise throughout the development of the we are also grateful to sasha luccioniopens in a new tab climate lead and researcher at huggingface for her help in forming the highlevel structure outlining what kinds of topics and case studies would best for these courses and recruiting many of the experts that either appear in guest speaker or have contributed behind the scenes
