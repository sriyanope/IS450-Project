teach english now foundational principles
through a series of engaging metaphors and stories prospective and current eflesl teachers will identify summarize and evaluate basic language paradigms learners will be presented information on such foundational principles as motivation risk taking two different modes of and balancing the teacher profession learners are also given an understanding of basic techniques founded on those principles such as teacher talk looking ridiculous in order to lower the affective filter and networking with these foundational principles in mind eslefl teachers will scrutinize common assumptions about language by comparing how they stack up to researchbased core principles

making meaning clear
this introduces learners to the role of a teacher in helping to motivate and properly engage learners it begins with a metaphor language is cake meaning that language must be presented well in order to be enjoyed we will actually perform a skit to show this meaning clearly this will demonstrate how a teacher can encourage a student and increase motivation by paying attention to techniques such as improving teacher talk scaffolding language and the use of body language to make meaning clear all of these while gained over the of a lifetime as a language teacher must be considered primary goals from the very beginning and all of these help a teacher recognize that presentation make a difference to learners not only in motivating them but in allowing them to understand the concepts presented
welcome language is cake language is cake technique and content making meaning clear teacher talk scaffolding and essential question teacher talk example advanced

modes of and interaction
learners are introduced to the distinction between and acquisition the distinction is made to help give learners context for the principle that language requires practice to introduce the importance of practice the distinction between a focused and diffuse mode of demonstrates that students who simply through memorizing vocabulary and grammar structures ie focused mode often dont acquire language structures on the other hand teachers who engage students in both a focused and diffuse mode like a basketball coach with his players are able to instruct but give time for that instruction to sink in through dedicated practice
acquisition vs two modes of language is basketball practice in the two modes and essential question

taking risks and learner strategies
using languagelearning expert francois gouins of going to germany and failing to german this demonstrates the need for learners to understand how a language is learned gouins demonstrates not only the need for a diffuse mode of wherein practice is valued but it also demonstrates the psyche of many second language learners francois in some sense was too smart for his own good relying on techniques for material that dont apply to language use and application students must use techniques and strategies that are proven to help someone acquire language like those from the good language learner studies teachers can facilitate student by helping to demonstrate good language learner principles
language is a stage lowering the affective filter language learner strategies good language learner strategies and essential question

the flipped model of language
while it was once considered impossible to be immersed in english outside of an englishspeaking country with the advent of the internet the world has changed and continues to change significantly this presents ways in which to use the internet and other resources to a teachers advantage and helps a teacher recognize their ability to engage students on cell phones tablets and computers introduction of the flipped classroom meaning that learners can engage in focused material etc outside the classroom and then engage in exercises and discussions within it
language outside the classroom thinking outside the classroom box language online student autonomy and essential question

lets talk about you teaching is a team sport freaking out over control lighting fires and essential question copy of and essential question

assessment
this review of the guides learners to understand the different metaphors that serve as guides to understanding the foundational principles presented
