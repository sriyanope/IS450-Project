introduction to cyber security
introduction to cyber security was designed to help learners develop a deeper understanding of modern information and system protection technology and methods the learning is simple we hope learners will develop a lifelong passion and appreciation for cyber security which we are certain will help in future endeavors students developers managers engineers and even private citizens will benefit from this learning special customized interviews with industry partners were included to help connect the cyber security concepts to live business

quizzes and projects for introduction to cyber security were designed to exercise the learners understanding and retention of the covered topics emphasis is on foundational issues rather than just memorizing facts the goal is to help learners develop the habit of properly assessing and improving cyber risk posture in real computing networking and software systems authentic scenarios are included based on practical enterprise and infrastructure deployments to enhance the learning
