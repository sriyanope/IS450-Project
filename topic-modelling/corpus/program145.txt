term structure models i
welcome to revisit the fixed income instruments so far we have been very comfortable with the notion of a fixed interest rate in reality however interest rate is always evolving over time previously we have seen that the evolution of stock prices can be modeled via multiperiod binomial models or the black scholes model but how do we capture the evolution of interest rate let us unfold the modeling of interest rate also see that all security derivatives have their equivalents in fixed income domains such as options forwards futures and swaps if you get stuck on the quizzes you should post on the discussions to ask for help and if you finish early i hope go there to help your fellow classmates as

option pricing and numerical approach
study option pricing via a numerical approach in many cases analytical explicit solution of option prices is not obtainable which requires numerical solutions for example if we switch the stock dynamics from geometric brownian motion to another model or switch the option from vanilla style to exotic style explicit pricing formula will become unrealistic firstly we start from introduction to options where you can different types of options and different perspectives of option market participants then talk about option pricing via numerical integration both in general and in details in particular focus on fourier transform and fast fourier transform fft we also provide python codes for you to how to apply these techniques in practice in the end of be exposed to several cases studies from time cost comparison to different models there are lots of models which estimates the stock price evolution among these models mainly focus on blackmertonscholes bms heston and variance gamma vg model where the motivation and characteristic of each model afterwards have an about option pricing where you can utilize all the theoretical knowledge and python codes to price different options under different stock dynamics
