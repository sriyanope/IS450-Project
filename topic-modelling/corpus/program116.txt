human factors requirements and challenges for humans teams and organizations
workload is the amount of an individual has to perform actual amount of vs the individuals perception of workload has to be considered assessment of operator workload has a vital impact on the design of manmachine systems occupational or workrelated stress is the response humans may when presented with demands and pressures that are not matched to their knowledge and abilities and challenge their ability to cope potentially resulting in inefficiencies inadequate manmachine cooperation and human error avoiding workload imbalance and occupational stress increases efficiency reliability and the safety of complex systems supporting the attainment of mission objectives in the process the ways in which digitised companies operate will be changing radically the company of the future will use digital means to manage its central functions such as its organisational structure and value creation future leaders will need to understand not only their generation smartphone plusemployees but will also have to accept nonhuman factors such as ai algorithms and robots as part of a team in such a radically changed environment with teams incorporating human and artificial intelligence general mental models have to be developed for the workings of an organization the products of the future and the requirements of the market and customers lecturer professor harald schaub iabg ottobrunn ottofriedrichuniversity bamberg

global navigation satellite systems gnss for efficient and flexible air navigation
civil aviation is a multitrilliondollar market projected to grow continuously until at least aircraft navigation and guidance from terminal to terminal is the determining cost factor for individual flights thus any savings resulting from the introduction of new digital technology will yield an extremely high return on investment due to economies of scale this outlines the specific navigation context before identifying where conventional navigation means flight routes are insufficient for achieving further increases in capacity flexibility and performance the concept of performancebased navigation pbn is outlined and why positioning needs to be available everywhere area navigation rnav the gnss basic positioning principle is described and the relatively frequent satellite failures and anomalies are explored which are the reason why standalone gnss cannot be used directly for a safetycritical application the concept of solution separation statistics combined with the use of multiple gnss constellations is introduced advanced receiver autonomous integrity monitoring araim which in the long term may replace conventional navigation technology the lecture concludes with a look at limiting factors the current planning of civil aviation authorities and the european gnss galileo lecturer professor thomas pany universitt der bundeswehr mnchen

modeling and simulation of aerospace systems with modelica
aircraft systems embrace a large set of physical domains hydraulic pneumatic and electrical systems all act within a confined space under extreme environmental conditions global optimisation of an aircraft including all of its systems thus demands a harmonised modelling approach so that all systems can be simulated and evaluated on a common platform modelica offers an open and free standard for multidomain modelling of physical systems individual components are modelled using differentialalgebraic equations while large complex systems can be composed using objectoriented methods the underlying principles of such modelling languages are explained lecture and how they can be applied for aircraft systems the resulting multidomain models afford digital representations of aircraft systems which can then be used to optimise aircraft design modern energy management methods can improve system performance while modelbased fault analysis methods help ensure safety and reliability lecturer dr dirk zimmer dlr german aerospace center

digital models and their compression in structurecontrol interaction problems
digital models for flexible aerospace system behaviour are often highorder and have to be reduced when used in combination with models from complementary disciplines or where many parametric iteration steps are required such as for design optimisation typical examples are controlstructure interaction problems such as vibration attenuation of satellite solar arrays and aeroelasticity and dynamic load alleviation of aircraft methods are discussed for realising a reduced order model rom from a higher order model to avoid multiple repetitions of oftencostly reduction processes in cases where model parameters are varied eg for system optimization model parameters should be set for these roms to yield socalled proms the effect of varied parameters can then be covered on the level of the previously established rom simply by updating these via the new relevant parameters the related methods are also called hard computing methods because of the mathematically based approach requiring a relatively wellstructured set of the initial fullorder systems of equations these methods can be applied to a multitude of aerospace problems such as vibration control for satellites in orbit and dynamic aeroelastic load alleviation for aircraft possibilities for reducing computational effort when using proms such as for design optimisation tasks for space structures are also discussed lecturer professor horst baier technical university munich
