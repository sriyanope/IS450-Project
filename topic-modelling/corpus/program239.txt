linux fundamentals
this is the first of a series that aims to prepare you for a role working as an information technology be introduced to the linux operating system about the licensing model and several linux distributions we will go through some services delivered in the linux operating system we will conclude this by looking at how to search and analyze text using command line tools in the operating system

linux operating system
welcome to linux operating system the first of the linux fundamentals by enrolling you are taking the first step to kick start your in information technology in the first of the we will about the history of the linux operating system its unique licensing model and the major distributions that are available to use by the end of this know how to choose a distribution install it and login to the command line so let us get started
overview history of linux linux licensing model linux distributions linux command line lab solution

linux services
in the second of this we will discuss the services available in the linux operating system we will explore many services including web servers and database servers among others we will look at how you start and stop services from running in the linux operating systems
servers vs desktops web servers database servers managing services lab solution

view create copy move and remove files
in the third of this we will how manage files and directories in the linux operating system we will discuss how to view create copy move and remove files we will look at creating links for files and directories lastly we will look at comparing text files
handle files and directories files and directory links reading files find and compare files lab solution

search and analyze text
in the fourth of this we will touch on how we can combine commands together in linux to create automatons and build new tools
filter text files redirect standard in out and error pipe filter editing text files lab solution

managing linux systems
we look at how to manage a system with the linux operating system installed the material is a good for anyone preparing for the linux foundation certified it associate lfca exam or just interested in more about linux

configure network connections
we look at how we can connect linux computers together we start by looking at linux network configuration files we then move to utilizing linux command line tools to configure network connections we will conclude the by looking at both basic and advanced network troubleshooting
network configuration files command line network configuration basic network troubleshooting advanced network troubleshooting lab solution

administering users and groups
in the second of this we will look at how to manage users that are authorized to use the linux system we will group the users into administrative groups so it is easier to manage the permissions for a set of users we will look at how to configure the environment for each user lastly we will look at how to interrogate information about users from the operating system
linux users linux user groups user configuration query user information lab solution

manage disk storage
in the third of this we will how to manage devices available to the linux system for long term storage we start by looking at disk partitions and file systems next we think about how we mount file systems lastly we look at how to monitor the file systems
hard drives partitions linux file systems linux file systems management linux file systems monitoring lab solution

managing software packages
in the fourth of this we how to install application software on a linux system we will start with a look at downloading tar files and compiling them we will follow up with thinking about software repositories lastly we will look at installing and updating software packages from the repositories
opensource packages software packages software repositories lab solution

linux cloud and devops
we look at cloud devops and the linux operating system the material is a good for anyone preparing for the linux foundation certified it associate lfca exam or just interested in more about linux this is the fourth in a series that aims to prepare you for working as an information technology

cloud computing models
we look at different cloud computing models we start with a look at softwareasaservice next we move on to infrastructureasaservice and think about the rule of linux in all the iaas services available lastly we look at platformasaservice and how linux can play a crucial role in future paas offerings
softwareasaservice saas platformasaservice paas infrastructureasaservice iaas

virtualization
we look at how to virtualize guest operating systems running under a linux host operating system we will differentiate different types of hypervisors used for the virtualization process next we will look at managing virtual machines running in a host linux system bootstrapping new installations and finally we will consider how to virtualize the network connections
hypervisor types virtual machines bootstrapping virtual networks

version control
we look at how we can manage versions of source control in the cloud using the git version control system we will talk about version control at an abstract level and then drill into the details on how to commit source code to a git repository and then follow up with how to merge different versions in git
version control committing changes merging versions lab solution

devops basics
we look at devops and the use of linux and the cloud we will think about containers and how we can orchestrate their configuration to replicate environments for the testing and deployment of software
devops containers docker containers orchestration

securing linux systems
we look at security and the linux operating system the material is a good for anyone preparing for the linux foundation certified it associate lfca exam or just interested in more about linux this is the third in a series that aims to prepare you for working as an information technology be introduced to ownership authentication and authorization we will drill into creating security through backups and redundancy we concluded by looking at how to secure the perimeter of our network and systems

ownership and permissions
we look at security and the linux operating system we will start by applying permissions to files and directories we then look at access control lists acl and how they are applied in linux we will explore contextbased security controls lastly we will think about account types and privilege escalation
file and directory permissions access control lists contextbased permissions account types and privilege escalation lab solution

administer access and authentication
we look at ways to increase our linux security we start by looking at linux pluggable authentication pam pam is a suite of libraries that allows a linux system administrator to configure methods to authenticate users we then look at public key infrastructure pki and its use in secure shell ssh we conclude by utilizing open virtual private networks vpn
pluggable authentication pam public key infrastructure pki secure shell ssh virtual private network vpn

logging backups
we look at both local and remote system logging we will also look at backup and compression of the files on the system to allow recovery in response to a system incident we will conclude with a deep dive of the different tools available in linux for archive and restore
system logging systemd journaling backups archive and restore tools lab solution

linux firewalls
we look at the security at the boundaries of your network and your host linux system we look at different linux firewall technologies and the implementation of access control rules in the firewalls we then think about forwarding packets when we want to allow traffic through the firewall to another host machine we conclude by looking at intrusion detection systems in linux
acl in firewalls firewall technologies packet forwarding intrusion detection systems
