successful presentation
few kinds of communication can have the effect of a powerful presentation even a short speech can motivate people to change longheld beliefs or to take action and a wonderfully delivered speech can transform a normal person into a leaderin this prof william kuskin provides a series of pragmatic and exercises for successful public speaking and presentations the develops through four themesmastering fear developing a creative formula using verbal and body language and anticipating the roomso that you can discover your personal power as a speaker and give excellent presentations successful presentations do not rely on perfect teeth a deep voice or an army of scriptwriters they depend largely on the same as successful business writing and graphic design clarity structure and revision the goal of the therefore is to enable you to discover your own internal power as a speaker and express it to the world after this with some practice be able to go into any situation and command the room for as long as you like this can be taken for academic credit as part of cu boulders master of science in data science msds degree offered on the coursera platform the msds is an interdisciplinary degree that brings together faculty from cu boulders departments of applied mathematics computer science information science and others with performancebased admissions and no application process the msds is ideal for individuals with a broad range of undergraduate education andor in computer science information science mathematics and statistics more about the msds at httpswwwcourseraorgdegreesmasterofsciencedatascienceboulder

getting started with public speaking
william tackles the one element that makes public speaking difficult fear unlike writing a memo or designing a slide deck presenting a speech puts you directly in front of an audience public speaking is wrapped up in the fear of immediate judgment and of lasting rejection yet the of writing and design are exactly the same as those of public speaking clarity structure revision and above all storytelling by applying these you can control your fear and take center stage in public the results will astound you
welcome to effective communication for new learners whats so great about the capstone for new learners welcome to successful presentation understanding fear the code rule survival reactions the paradox of public speaking weve all felt fear successful presentation is storytelling stories and storytellers performance

a formula for successful presentation
like the second of business writing this zeroes in on a practical formula for successful presentations william establishes this structure and then breaks down it down into modular elements so the most complex presentations can be created easily revised effectively and delivered confidently still no onesizefitsall outline no rigid set of rules is capable of expressing your own personality and unlocking your own brilliance and so william goes beyond the basic formula to teach you the secret ingredient to public speaking creativity
the basic formula the secret ingredient creativity what is creativity the central importance of the introduction the introduction the salutation the introduction the review of the structure the introduction the one compelling point kuskin receives his for coursera presentation intro the modular content unit pushing each unit thinking in circles building transitions how do you push yourself the conclusion the entire talk is a circle

practicing your self
weve all sat through presentations that had solid content but just didnt seem to sometimes its hard to define why a speaker fails to deliver the key is practice practice is tricky however because poor practice techniques actually make a dull presentation even dullerfurther from the inspiring passionate you want to create for your audience in three william redefines the notion of practice as a dynamic process of verbal and physical language and then teaches you how focus your language to express your personal style of passion three teaches you to put passion in a bottle and release it when you want
dynamic vs static getting into your brand you are your own harshest critic the reverse outline rehearsing the introduction passion in a bottle hearing your language marking your script recognizing your body using your body the importance of stance

engaging with the world
youve put away your fear youve used the formula to write a clear talk and youve tweaked it with the secret ingredient of creativity youve rehearsed and mastered your personal verbal and physical language still a conference room or a lecture hall is an unpredictable arena one that contains an uncontrollable amount of variables the layout of the space the mood of the audience the complexity of the questionsthese are the elements of a presentation for which you can never fully prepare how do you actually get ready to walk out on stage the last of successful presentation teaches you how to anticipate the field of the play so you are flexible agile and confident it lays out in simple terms how to deal with interruptions and hostility alike concluding the by looking ahead to how you develop your own identity not merely as a public speaker but as powerful individual
anticipating the field of play a chaucerian interlude attending to your audience slides vs handouts what is a question being soft averys demo presentation frankenstein and science building a public portfolio from the private self the paradox of the public self effective communication
