linear regression for business statistics
regression analysis is perhaps the single most important business statistics tool used in the industry regression is the engine behind a multitude of data analytics applications used for many forms of forecasting and prediction this is the fourth in the business statistics and analysis the introduces you to the very important tool known as linear regression to apply various procedures such as dummy variable regressions transforming variables and interaction effects all these are introduced and explained using easy to understand examples in microsoft excel the focus of the is on understanding and application rather than detailed mathematical derivations note this uses the data analysis tool box which is standard with the windows version of microsoft excel it is also standard with the or later mac version of excel however it is not standard with earlier versions of excel for mac regression analysis an introduction get introduced to the linear regression model we will build a regression model and estimate it using excel we will use the estimated model to infer relationships between various variables and use the model to make predictions the also introduces the notion of errors residuals and rsquare in a regression model topics covered include introducing the linear regression building a regression model and estimating it using excel making inferences using the estimated model using the regression model to make predictions errors residuals and rsquare regression analysis hypothesis testing and goodness of fit this presents different hypothesis tests you could do using the regression output these tests are an important part of inference and the introduces them using excel based examples the pvalues are introduced along with goodness of fit measures rsquare and the adjusted rsquare towards the end of we introduce the dummy variable regression which is used to incorporate categorical variables in a regression topics covered include hypothesis testing in a linear regression goodness of fit measures rsquare adjusted rsquare dummy variable regression using categorical variables in a regression regression analysis dummy variables multicollinearity this continues with the application of dummy variable regression you get to understand the interpretation of regression output in the presence of categorical variables examples are worked out to reinforce various concepts introduced the also explains what is multicollinearity and how to deal with it topics covered include dummy variable regression using categorical variables in a regression interpretation of coefficients and pvalues in the presence of dummy variables multicollinearity in regression models regression analysis various extensions the extends your understanding of the linear regression introducing techniques such as meancentering of variables and building confidence bounds for predictions using the regression model a powerful regression extension known as interaction variables is introduced and explained using examples we also study the transformation of variables in a regression and in that context introduce the loglog and the semilog regression models topics covered include mean centering of variables in a regression model building confidence bounds for predictions using a regression model interaction effects in a regression transformation of variables the loglog and semilog regression models

basic data descriptors statistical distributions and application to business decisions
the ability to understand and apply business statistics is becoming increasingly important in the industry a good understanding of business statistics is a requirement to make correct and relevant interpretations of data lack of knowledge could lead to erroneous decisions which could potentially have negative consequences for a firm this is designed to introduce you to business statistics we begin with the notion of descriptive statistics which is summarizing data using a few numbers different categories of descriptive measures are introduced and discussed along with the excel functions to calculate them the notion of probability or uncertainty is introduced along with the concept of a sample and population data using relevant business examples this leads us to various statistical distributions along with their excel functions which are then used to model or approximate business processes you get to apply these descriptive measures of data and various statistical distributions using easytofollow excel based examples which are demonstrated throughout the courseto successfully complete students must have access to microsoft excel basic data descriptors get to understand calculate and interpret various descriptive or measures of data these descriptive measures summarize and present data using a few numbers appropriate excel functions to do these calculations are introduced and demonstrated topics covered include categories of descriptive data measures of central tendency the mean median mode and their interpretations and calculations measures of spreadindata the range interquartilerange standard deviation and variance box plots interpreting the standard deviation measure using the ruleofthumb and chebyshevs theorem descriptive measures of association probability and statistical distributions this presents the covariance and correlation measures and their respective excel functions you get to understand the notion of causation versus correlation the then introduces the notion of probability and random variables and starts introducing statistical distributions topics covered include measures of association the covariance and correlation measures causation versus correlation probability and random variables discrete versus continuous data introduction to statistical distributions the normal distribution this introduces the normal distribution and the excel function to calculate probabilities and various from the distribution topics covered include probability density function and area under the curve as a measure of probability the normal distribution bell curve normdist norminv functions in excel working with distributions normal binomial poisson see various applications of the normal distribution also get introduced to the binomial and poisson distributions the central limit theorem is introduced and explained in the context of understanding sample data versus population data and the link between the two topics covered include various applications of the normal distribution the binomial and poisson distributions sample versus population data the central limit theorem
