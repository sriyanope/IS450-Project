immunology the immune system and its failures
our online immunology has been developed to provide central concepts in human immunology as as advanced topics from cuttingedge research relating to clinical disease of the immune system over five designated specialisations
the initial two courses discuss the role of the innate and adaptive immune responses serving to protect the body from harmful pathogens which if dysregulated can also lead to immunemediated diseases such as immunodeficiencies autoimmunity allergy and chronic infection evaluated in the remaining three courses
