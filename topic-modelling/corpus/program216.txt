introduction to environmental science
to understand current environmental problems we need to consider physical biological chemical processes that are often the basis of those problems this will give you the necessary to address the environmental issues we are facing today by examining scientific principles and the application of those principles to natural systems this surveys some of the many environmental science topics at an introductory level ultimately considering the sustainability of human activities on the planet
environmental impacts on earth come from the number of people the amount and types of resources that they use by applying scientific principles and considering realworld examples examine
the field of environmental science and how to think like an environmental scientist
the human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment
agriculture soils and the environmental implications of eating meat vegetables local organic sustainable industrial and other types of food
nonrenewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal petroleum natural gas and the benefits consequences of using each
renewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable green energy sources have impacts as as benefits
biodiversity and global change which are the integrating units of environmental science

the three courses comprising the introduction to environmental science utilize lectures
case studies from various sites in and around dartmouth
interviews with experts

both prompted and open discussions
and one graded quiz per
</DOC>

environmental science
the introduction to environmental science explores the field of environmental science and encourages participants to understand how environmental scientists think it addresses some important questions such as
what is the difference between environmental science and environmental studies how do both differ from environmentalism why is energy so important in environmental science what do you mean by biodiversity also explore what global cycles are and how they impact our lives you must be aware that the human impact on biodiversity and global change are two of the most important discussion points in environmental science have you ever wondered how we are affecting global change and biodiversity how can we reconcile human population growth resource demands and sustainability the effects of global change on humans and natural ecosystems and additional factors in evaluating personal environmental impact will also be discussed
</DOC>
<DOC>basics of environmental science
this explores the importance of environmental science the water pollution problems and how cycling of matter takes place

global change basics greenhouse gases
</DOC>
<DOC>
population food and soil
this explores the populationenvironment relationship about the human population and the ways in which changes in the population affect the environment agriculture soils and the environmental implications of eating meat vegetables local organic sustainable industrial and other types of food are discussed too
we explore questions such as how many people live on earth right now what is the carrying capacity of earth what is the relationship between the number of people where they live the resources they consume and their environmental impact what types of agriculture are used right now what is the difference between organic and conventional agriculture why would you want to dig a soil pit a conversation with phil connors an australian environmental scientist will explore the topic of human population and sustainability also listen to the conversations with danielle allen an organic farmer and justin richardson a soil scientist
</DOC>
<DOC>population and the world
this explores the global population trends how and why population changes and concepts related to population numbers including growth rate doubling time crude birth and date rates etc
introduction the world today population numbers how and why populations change

<DOC>agriculture and environment
this deals with the major environmental issues related to global human nutrition some common practices of modern industrial agriculture and the potential environmental costs associated with each practice it also explores sustainable farming practices
agriculture and human nutrition modern agriculture effects part modern agriculture effects part modern agriculture alternatives
</DOC>

<DOC>soil and environment
this explores the role of soils in ecosystems soil horizons and soilforming processes through a about the soils of a particular landscape and about various soilforming processes
the soil resource a soil profile a conversation with danielle allen food and soils review
</DOC>
<DOC>
energy and environment
this deals with both renewable and nonrenewable energy by applying scientific principles and considering realworld examples examine
nonrenewable fossil fuels with a focus on coal petroleum and natural gas and the benefits and consequences of using each renewable fuels such as wind and solar and identify that even renewable green energy sources have impacts as as benefits biodiversity and global change which are the integrating units of environmental science additionally explore answers to the following questions how do we evaluate coal oil and natural gas from an environmental science perspective what regulates energy conversions and losses in humanbuilt systems how much energy flows through your fingertips how do we evaluate hydro solar wind and biomass from an environmental science perspective how can we increase efficiency and conservation you also take a tour of the dartmouth powerplant and listen to a conversation with dartmouth sustainability director rosi kerr furthermore take a field trip to a pv tracker solar system visit a straw bale house and have a conversation about waste vegetable oil as an energy source in india
