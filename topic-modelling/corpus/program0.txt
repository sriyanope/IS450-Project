having an intruder inside your systems for months unnoticed by system administrators security specialists and end users alike is tantamount to giving the intruder the keys to your business or organization in far too many cases organizations discover that they have been subjected to a data breach by being told by someone else that their private data has been offered for sale on the dark web leading voices within the security profession state we must do better at detecting the intruder in our midst many say that detecting the intruder should be the priority for security professionals ransomware attacks have become big business involving not only largescale extortion attacks but also the selling of ransomware attack tools and services and exploitation of data exfiltrated during the breach government officials and industry professionals around the world such as anne neuberger us deputy national security advisor for cyber and emerging technology have raised their voices about this new and very troubling variant in the advanced persistent threat apt attackers business model focus on incident response and recovery explore the incident life cycle as defined by nist and continue with a deeper look at supporting forensic investigations also extend these ideas and concepts around the theme of business continuity and disaster recovery

risk identification monitoring and analysis
this is the third under the sscp explore how to manage the risks related to information systems it is time to bring these ideas together in a context of continuous maturity modeling measuring and monitoring which see is focused on the here and now risk alignment works best at the strategic longterm level of planning
risk maturation by contrast can be most effective when considered in the daytoday of business operations this is sometimes called operationalizing the approach to risk management and maturation learning objectives after completing this the participant will be able to identify common risks and vulnerabilities describe risk management concepts recognize risk management frameworks provide examples of appropriate risk tolerance provide examples of appropriate risk treatment identify risks of noncompliance with laws and regulations identify appropriate methods for risk management frameworks implementation indicate the range and scope of risk review identify the components of risk review describe vulnerability assessment activities used to examine all aspects of network and system security review the steps for monitoring incident detection and data loss prevention classify the use of tools that collect information about the it environment to better examine the organizations security posture identify events of interest to focus on those that may be part of an attack or intrusion select methods for managing log files describe tools and methods for analyzing the results of monitoring efforts identify communication requirements when documenting and reporting the results of monitoring security platforms who should take this beginners required no prior required

in management science terms maturing a process or practice means taking positive steps over time to make it more reliable repeatable and efficient in practice this means getting better each day while being able to show the measurements that both demonstrate improvement and suggest other to improve risk management for organizations works best when it uses evidencebased reasoning to identify and characterize issues and take actions as necessary to deal with them this will explore how to manage the risks related to information systems it is time to bring these ideas together in a context of continuous maturity modeling measuring and monitoring which see is focused on the here and now risk alignment works best at the strategic longterm level of planning risk maturation by contrast can be most effective when considered in the daytoday of business operations this is sometimes called operationalizing the approach to risk management and maturation
