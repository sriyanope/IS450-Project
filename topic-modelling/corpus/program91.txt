data mining project
note you should complete all the other courses before beginning this
this sixweek long project of the data mining will allow you to apply the learned algorithms and techniques for data mining from the previous courses in the including pattern discovery clustering text retrieval text mining and visualization to solve interesting realworld data mining challenges specifically on a restaurant review data set from yelp and use all the knowledge and youve learned from the previous courses to mine this data set to discover interesting and useful knowledge the design of the project emphasizes simulating the workflow of a data miner in a real job setting
integrating different mining techniques covered in multiple individual courses
experimenting with different ways to solve a problem to deepen your understanding of techniques
and allowing you to propose and explore your own ideas creatively the goal of the project is to analyze and mine a large yelp review data set to discover useful knowledge to help people make decisions in dining the project will include the following outputs opinion visualization explore and visualize the review content to understand what people have said in those reviews cuisine map construction mine the data set to understand the landscape of different types of cuisines and their similarities discovery of popular dishes for a cuisine mine the data set to discover the commonpopular dishes of a particular cuisine recommendation of restaurants to help people decide where to dine mine the data set to rank restaurants for a specific dish and predict the hygiene condition of a restaurant from the perspective of users a cuisine map can help them understand what cuisines are there and see the big picture of all kinds of cuisines and their relations once they decide what cuisine to try they would be interested in knowing what the popular dishes of that cuisine are and decide what dishes to have finally they will need to choose a restaurant thus recommending restaurants based on a particular dish would be useful moreover predicting the hygiene condition of a restaurant would also be helpful by working on these tasks gain with a typical workflow in data mining that includes data preprocessing data exploration data analysis improvement of analysis methods and presentation of results have an to combine multiple algorithms from different courses to complete a relatively complicated mining task and experiment with different ways to solve a problem to understand the best way to solve it suggest specific approaches but you are highly encouraged to explore your own ideas since open exploration is by design a goal of the project you are required to submit a brief report for each of the tasks for peer grading a final consolidated report is also required which will be peergraded

text retrieval and search engines
recent years have seen a dramatic growth of natural language text data including web pages news articles scientific literature emails enterprise documents and social media such as blog articles forum posts product reviews and tweets text data are unique in that they are usually generated directly by humans rather than a computer system or sensors and are thus especially valuable for discovering knowledge about peoples opinions and preferences in addition to many other kinds of knowledge that we encode in text
this will cover search engine technologies which play an important role in any data mining applications involving text data for two reasons first while the raw data may be large for any particular problem it is often a relatively small subset of the data that are relevant and a search engine is an essential tool for quickly discovering a small subset of relevant text data in a large text collection second search engines are needed to help analysts interpret any patterns discovered in the data by allowing them to examine the relevant original text data to make sense of any discovered pattern the basic concepts principles and the major techniques in text retrieval which is the underlying science of search engines
