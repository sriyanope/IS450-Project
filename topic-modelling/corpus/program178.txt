we focus on monitoring managing and improving data quality be able to explain how to monitor data on a daytoday basis to see that it remains consistent explain how measures can help us monitor the patient health and the quality of care they receive over time also be able to discuss establishing the culture of quality throughout the data lifecycle and improving data quality from the baseline by posing questions to determine a baseline of data quality be able to manage data quality through expected and unexpected changes along with tracking monitoring strategies along the data pipeline after this be able to identify and fix common deficiencies in the data and implement change control systems as a monitoring tool also recall several best practices you can apply on the job to monitor data quality in the healthcare field
introduction establishing the culture of quality throughout the data lifecycle improving data quality from the baseline managing data quality expected and unexpected changes monitoring strategies along the data pipeline

sustaining quality through data governance
iin this we focus on sustaining quality through data governance define data governance and consider why it matters in healthcare discuss who makes up data governance committees how these committees function relative to data analysts and describe how stakeholders together to ensure data quality be able to describe how highquality data is a valuable asset for any business also define data governance systems recall several ways data can be repurposed and explain how data governance maintains data quality as it is repurposed for a use other than that for which it was originally gathered in addition to your lessons read and discuss the article big data bigger and practice applying some of these important concepts
