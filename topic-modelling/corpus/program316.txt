execution
after extensive data gathering and planning it is finally time to execute our plan to construct our renewable energy plant and to generate renewable energy getting to this point has been a long process but recall that a failure to plan is planning to fail we describe the steps required to construct a renewable energy plant commission it to ensure it is operating properly and then to operate and maintain the plant over its intended lifespan finally at the end of its life we will need to determine if the plant can be economically repowered or if it should be decommissioned and torn down
introduction to preparation residential preparation largescale preparation resource evaluation contracting site planning and design technology and vendor selection financial forecasting financial structuring introduction to construction and operations construction ongoing operations and maintenance decommissioning

final assessment
