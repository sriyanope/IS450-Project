android app development
this enables learners to successfully apply core java programming languages features software patterns needed to develop maintainable mobile apps comprised of core android components as well as fundamental java io persistence mechanisms the capstone will integrate the material from throughout the to exercise and assess the ability of learners to create an interesting android app by applying knowledge and learned in previous moocs including java programming features android studio tools android activity components material design file io and data persistence unit testing and software patterns the itself will be similar in design goals to previous however it will provide less of the skeleton code than earlier moocs provide to enable more creativity to learners and greater for learners to customize the app

java for android
this mooc teaches you how to core features and classes from the java programming language that are used in android which is the dominant platform for developing and deploying mobile device apps in particular this mooc covers key java programming language features that control the flow of execution through an app such as javas various looping constructs and conditional statements enable access to structured data such as javas builtin arrays and common classes in the java collections framework such as arraylist and hashmap group related operations and data into classes and interfaces such as javas primitive and userdefined types fields methods generic parameters and exceptions customize the behavior of existing classes via inheritance and polymorphism such as subclassing and overriding virtual methods learners will apply these java features in the context of core android components such as activities and basic ui elements by applying common tools such as android studio needed to develop java programs and useful android apps learners will on several handson throughout the mooc ie each will require learners to write solutions to programming that reinforce the material covered in the lecture there will be roughly hours of student engagement time per including lectures quizzes and programming

mooc overview
