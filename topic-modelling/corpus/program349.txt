data collection online telephone and facetoface
this presents research conducted to increase our understanding of how data collection decisions affect survey errors this is not a howtodoit on data collection but instead reviews the literature on survey design decisions and data quality in order to sensitize learners to how alternative survey designs might impact the data obtained from those surveysthe reviews a range of survey data collection methods that are both interviewbased facetoface and telephone and selfadministered paper questionnaires that are mailed and those that are implemented online ie as web surveys mixed mode designs are also covered as well as several hybrid modes for collecting sensitive information eg selfadministering the sensitive questions in what is otherwise a facetoface interview the also covers newer methods such as mobile web and sms text message interviews and examines alternative data sources such as social media it concentrates on the impact these techniques have on the quality of survey data including error from measurement nonresponse and coverage and assesses the tradeoffs between these error sources when researchers choose a mode or survey design

introduction classic modes of survey data collection
lesson be introduced to some key concepts about survey data collection methods that we will rely on throughout the by the end of this lesson you should be well acquainted with the major sources of survey error and how these are affected usually in the form of tradeoffs by the particular mode used to administer questions and capture responses
what this is and is not introduction to survey errors variable error and bias total survey error what do we mean by mode mode choice by respondent mixed mode design concurrent mixed mode sequential followup mixed mode interview with david weir u michigan on mixed mode designs response rates nonresponse error

selfadministration online data collection
this second lesson focuses on modes in which survey respondents selfadminister questions and provide their responses directly to researchers by the end of lesson understand the pros and cons of selfadministered modes from the tse perspective

framework for data collection and analysis
this will provide you with an overview over existing data products and a good understanding of the data collection landscape with the help of various examples how to identify which data sources likely matches your research question how to turn your research question into measurable pieces and how to think about an analysis plan furthermore this will provide you with a general framework that allows you to not only understand each step required for a successful data collection and analysis but also help you to identify errors associated with different data sources some metrics to quantify each potential error and thus have tools at hand to describe the quality of a data source finally we will introduce different large scale data collection efforts done by private industry and government agencies and review the learned concepts through these examples this is suitable for beginners as well as those that know about one particular data source but not others and are looking for a general framework to evaluate data products

research designs and data sources
the first in the provides an overview of the topics to come this walks you through the process of data collection and analysis starting with a research question and a review of existing data sources we cover survey data collection techniques highlight the importance of data curation and discuss some basic features that can affect your data analysis when dealing with sample data issues of data access and resources for access are introduced
research question design types of data examples of found data visualizing the data generation process data curation data analysis access issues access resources

measurements and analysis plan
we will emphasize the importance of having a wellspecified research question and analysis plan we will provide an overview over the various data collection strategies a variety of available modes for data collection and some thinking on how to choose the right mode
issues with inductive reasoning planning on what you want to observe planning on how to collect data new modes web and google choosing a mode

quality framework
be introduced to a general framework that allows you to not only understand each step required for a successful data collection and analysis but also helps you to identify errors associated with different data sources some metrics to quantify each potential error and thus have tools at hand to describe the quality of a data source
quality of data inference survey life cycle from a design perspective measurement survey life cycle from a design perspective representation survey lifecycle from a process perspective survey lifeycle from a quality perspective survey lifecycle from a quality perspective ii metrics survey lifecycle from a quality perspective iii coverage and sampling

application of tse framework to existing surveys
we introduce a few surveys across a variety of topics for each we highlight data collection features the surveys span a variety of topics we challenge you to think about alternative data sources that can be used to gather the same information or insights

combining and analyzing complex data
how to use survey weights to estimate descriptive statistics like means and totals and more complicated quantities like model parameters for linear and logistic regressions software capabilities will be covered with r receiving particular emphasis the will also cover the basics of record linkage and statistical matchingboth of which are becoming more important as ways of combining data from different sources combining of datasets raises ethical issues which the reviews informed consent may have to be obtained from persons to allow their data to be linked about differences in the legal requirements in different countries

basic estimation
after completing and of this understand how to estimate descriptive statistics overall and for subgroups when you deal with survey data we will review software for estimation r stata sas with examples for how to estimate things like means proportions and totals also how to estimate parameters in linear logistic and other models and software options with emphasis on r and discuss how you can add additional data to your analysis this requires knowing about record linkage techniques and what it takes to get permission to link data
overview basic r examples basic r examples continued degrees of freedom estimating means multistage samples quantile estimation in r

models
covers how to estimate linear and logistic model parameters using survey data after completing this understand how the methods used differ from the ones for nonsurvey data we also cover the features of survey data sets that need to be accounted for when estimating standard errors of estimated model parameters

record linkage
starts with the current debate on using more linked administrative records in the us federal statistical system and a general motivation for linking records several examples will be given on why it is useful to link data challenges of record linkage will be discussed a brief overview over key linkage techniques is included as well
why we link records gentle introduction challenges key techniques

dealing with missing data
this will cover the steps used in weighting sample surveys including methods for adjusting for nonresponse and using data external to the survey for calibration among the techniques discussed are adjustments using estimated response propensities poststratification raking and general regression estimation alternative techniques for imputing values for missing items will be discussed for both weighting and imputation the capabilities of different statistical software packages will be covered including r stata and sas

general steps in weighting
weights are used to expand a sample to a population to accomplish this the weights may correct for coverage errors in the sampling frame adjust for nonresponse and reduce variances of estimators by incorporating covariates the series of steps needed to do this are covered in
introduction quantities to estimate goals of estimation statistical interpretation of estimates coverage problems improving precision effects of weighting on ses

specific steps
specific steps in weighting include computing base weights adjusting if there are cases whose eligibility we are unsure of adjusting for nonresponse and using covariates to calibrate the sample to external population controls we flesh out the general steps with specific details here
overview base weights nonresponse adjustments response propensities tree algorithms calibration

implementing the steps
software is critical to implementing the steps but the r system is an excellent source of free routines this covers several r packages including sampling survey and practools that will select samples and compute weights
software base weights more on base weights nonresponse adjustments examples of calibration software for poststratification

imputing for missing items
in most surveys there will be items for which respondents do not provide information even though the respondent completed enough of the data collection instrument to be considered complete if only the cases with all items present are retained when fitting a model quite a few cases may be excluded from the analysis imputing for the missing items avoids dropping the missing cases we cover methods of doing the imputing and of reflecting the effects of imputations on standard errors

sampling people networks and records
good data collection is built on good samples but the samples can be chosen in many ways samples can be haphazard or convenient selections of persons or records or networks or other units but one questions the quality of such samples especially what these selection methods mean for drawing good conclusions about a population after data collection and analysis is done samples can be more carefully selected based on a researchers judgment but one then questions whether that judgment can be biased by personal factors samples can also be draw in statistically rigorous and careful ways using random selection and control methods to provide sound representation and cost control it is these last kinds of samples that will be discussed we will examine simple random sampling that can be used for sampling persons or records cluster sampling that can be used to sample groups of persons or records or networks stratification which can be applied to simple random and cluster samples systematic selection and stratified multistage samples the concludes with a brief overview of how to estimate and summarize the uncertainty of randomized sampling
