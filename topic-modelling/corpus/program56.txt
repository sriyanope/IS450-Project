c programming with linux
c programming with linux of seven short courses how to write read and debug computer programs in the c programming language while also becoming familiar with the linux operating system
why c and not another programming language did you know that smartphones your cars navigation system robots drones trains and almost all electronic devices have some ccode running under the hood c is used in any circumstance where speed and flexibility are important such as in embedded systems or highperformance computing
c is a foundational programming language taught at engineering schools around the world and represents one of the building blocks of modern computer information technology invented in the s it is still one of the most stable and popular programming languages in the world
along with the c programming language comes linux an essential operating system used by most computer scientists and developers linux powers almost all supercomputers and most of the servers worldwide as as all android devices and most internet of things devices this will introduce the linux command line and linux tools for c programmers
both of which are musthave in todays tech industries
our dedicated international team is excited to introduce you to the world of coding and guide you along your path to becoming a skilled c programmer and help you pursue a in computer engineering

beginners even those without any programming will be able to immediately start coding in c through our new coding tools within the web browser no need to install anything
practice through guided exercises and short coding demonstrations as as more elaborate

c programming advanced data types
define your own data types in c and use the newly created types to more efficiently store and process your data
many programming languages provide a number of builtin data types to store things such as integers decimals and characters in variables but what if you wanted to store more complex data defining your own data types in c allows you to more efficiently store and process data such as a customers name age and other relevant data all in one single variable also gain with programming concepts that are foundational to any programming language why c and not another programming language did you know that smartphones your cars navigation system robots drones trains and almost all electronic devices have some ccode running under the hood c is used in any circumstance where speed and flexibility are important such as in embedded systems or highperformance computing at the end of this short reach the fifth milestone of the c programming with linux unlocking the door to a in computer engineering your job outlook programmers developers engineers managers and related industries within scientific computing and data science
