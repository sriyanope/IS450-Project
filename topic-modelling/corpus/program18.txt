algebra elementary to advanced
this is intended for students looking to solidify their algebra and geometry necessary to be successful in future courses that will require precalculus and calculus quantitiative and reasoning are presented throughout the to train students to think logically reason with data and make informed decisions

instead of a single large project there are many smaller applied and algebra problems throughout the of the courses practice problems with worked solutions are provided throughout the to prepare students and allow them to be successful problems range in difficulty to allow students to be challenged as they apply the knowledge gained from the

algebra elementary to advanced polynomials and roots
this is the final in a three part algebra sequence students extend their knowledge of more advanced functions and apply and model them using both algebraic and geometric techniques this enables students to make logical deductions and arrive at reasonable conclusions such are crucial in todays world knowing how to analyze quantitative information for the purpose of making decisions judgments and predictions is essential for understanding many important social and political issues quantitative and reasoning provides students the needed for evaluating such quantitativelybased arguments
this class is important as the mathematical ideas it treats and the mathematical language and symbolic manipulation it uses to express those ideas are essential for students who will progress to calculus statistics or data science

exponentials
the ubiquitous occurrence of the exponential function in pure and applied mathematics has led mathematician w rudin to opine that the exponential function is the most important function in mathematics in applied settings exponential functions model a relationship in which a constant change in the independent variable gives the same proportional change ie percentage increase or decrease in the dependent variable this occurs widely in the natural and social sciences as in a selfreproducing population a fund accruing compound interest or a growing body of manufacturing expertise thus the exponential function also appears in a variety of contexts within physics chemistry engineering mathematical biology and economics
introduction to exponentials exponential equations

polynomials
in mathematics a polynomial is an expression consisting of variables also called indeterminates and coefficients that involves only the operations of addition subtraction multiplication and nonnegative integer exponentiation of variables polynomials generalize our linear and quadratic functions that we have studied so far an example of a polynomial is x x polynomials appear in many areas of mathematics and science for example they are used to form polynomial equations which encode a wide range of problems from elementary word problems to complicated scientific problems they are used to define polynomial functions which appear in settings ranging from basic chemistry and physics to economics and social science they are used in calculus and numerical analysis to approximate other functions

roots
about roots of real numbers roots arise naturally as solutions to the polynomial equation xn a square roots help to solve quadratic polynomials the square root of a nonnegative number is used in the definition of euclidean distance as as in generalizations such as hilbert spaces it defines an important concept of standard deviation used in probability theory and statistics it has a major use in the formula for roots of a quadratic equation quadratic fields and rings of quadratic integers which are based on square roots are important in algebra and have uses in geometry square roots frequently appear in mathematical formulas elsewhere as as in many physical laws generalizing square roots lead to nth roots their properties and applications

algebra elementary to advanced equations inequalities
this is intended for students looking to create a solid algebraic foundation of fundamental mathematical concepts from which to take more advanced courses that use concepts from precalculus calculus probability and statistics this will help solidify your computational methods review algebraic formulas and properties and apply these concepts model real world situations this is for any student who will use algebraic in future mathematics courses topics include the real numbers equalities inequalities polynomials rational expressions and equations graphs relations and functions radicals and exponents and quadratic equations

the structure of numbers
georg cantor was a famous mathematician who formalized the notion of set theory which had a profound impact on research and teaching sets and the relations between them for a basis for teaching the concept of the structure of real numbers starting with the concept of a natural number the whole numbers integers rationals and real numbers are developed as as operations defined on them properties of the real numbers are formalized and applied as
real numbers properties of real numbers

linear equations
a linear relationship between two variables occurs when there is a constant increase or constant decrease in one variable with respect to the other linear equations have the property that any change in the independent variable results in a proportional change in the dependent variable many physical situations can be modelled using a linear relationship when data is visualized on a scatterplot we often are interested in the line of best fit or the regression line linear equations occur frequently in all mathematics and their applications in physics and engineering partly because nonlinear systems are often approximated by linear equations

solving inequalities
the relative position of two points on a coordinate line is used to define an inequality relationship on the set of real numbers we say that a is less than b written ab when the real number a lies to the left of the real number b on the coordinate line from this definition other inequalities naturally follow
linear inequalities in one variable linear inequalities in two variables

systems of equations
recall that a single linear equation in two variables is an equation of the form ax by c where a and b are both nonzero real constants there are infinitely may ordered pairs that satisfy a single linear equation in applications however we are often interested in finding a single ordered pair that satisfies a pair of linear equations section we discuss several methods for solving this problem

algebra elementary to advanced functions applications
after completing this students will how to successfully apply functions to model different data and real world occurrences this reviews the concept of a function and then provide multiple examples of common and uncommon types of functions used in a variety of disciplines formulas domains ranges graphs intercepts and fundamental behavior are all analyzed using both algebraic and analytic techniques from this core set of functions new functions are created by arithmetic operations and function composition these functions are then applied to solve real world problems the ability to picture many different types of functions will help students how and when to apply these functions as as give students the geometric intuition to understand the algebraic techniques the and objectives from this improve problem solving abilities

introduction to functions
a linear relationship between two variables occurs when there is a constant increase or constant decrease in one variable with respect to the other linear functions have the property that any chance in the independent variable results in a proportional change in the dependent variable many physical situations can be modeled using a linear relationship adding an extra term of the form ax to a linear function creates a quadratic function and its graph is the parabola see examples of linear and quadratic functions and their applications in the sections that follow
linear functions quadratic functions

other common functions
in the last we introduced the important concept of a function and considered the linear and quadratic functions we discuss methods for building new functions from those that are already familiar to use one method will use the graph shifting techniques already introduced these methods are developed further and applied to new functions constructing a graph is often an important first step in solving a problem the more functions you can picture the better problem solver be
