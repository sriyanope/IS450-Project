</DOC>
<DOC>clinical trial sample size
sample size calculation in clinical trials refers to the process for determining how large a trial needs to be in order to have a reasonable expectation of detecting a difference between groups the end result of the sample size calculation should be an estimate of the number of observations
definitions and introduction sampling and assumptions practicalities

clinical trials data management and quality assurance
to collect and care for the data gathered during your trial and how to prevent mistakes and errors through quality assurance practices clinical trials generate an enormous amount of data so you and your team must plan carefully by choosing the right collection instruments systems and measures to protect the integrity of your trial data how to assemble clean and deidentify your datasets finally to find and correct deficiencies through performance monitoring manage treatment interventions and implement quality assurance protocols
</DOC>
<DOC>data collection instruments
this covers the design and organization of data collection instruments to be used in a clinical trial a welldesigned data collection instrument is critically important to the success of a trial because it determines the way that the data are defined collected and organized a study without a welldesigned data collection instrument is likely to encounter otherwise avoidable problems
definitions and introduction general principles design considerations data collection instrument dci and database interactions data collection instrument dci revisions other data collection instrument dci issues
</DOC>

<DOC>data management
about data management in the context of clinical trials definitions and core concepts and explore a few different frequently used data management systems look closely at excel and other spreadsheet programs because they are widely used and help illustrate broader data management principles also about data integrity which incorporates features of data security redundancy and preservation
definitions and database systems excel external data data integrity
</DOC>

<DOC>data assembly and distribution
data assembly involves preparing data for distribution to others the necessary steps for creating datasets for sharing cover data freezes and data locking as as cleaning deidentification sharing and standards that you and your team can use to make your data more useful
data freeze and data lock data cleaning deidentification data sharing data standards
</DOC>

<DOC>performance monitoring
how to conduct performance monitoring in clinical trials specifically discuss a framework for monitoring clinical center performance and protocol adherence through all phases of the trial from startup through followup the will conclude with a brief of site visits an important part of a performance monitoring toolkit
introduction to performance monitoring performance monitoring by trial stage site visits
</DOC>

<DOC>intervention management
about the principles of managing treatment interventions theres a considerable amount of heterogeneity in clinical trials so a number of factors can influence how you deal with the intervention factors include the hypothesis the design whether it is an improved intervention and whether it is licensed or experimental also about different types of drug formulations and how they factor into masking protocols

</DOC>
<DOC>protocol events
protocol events are problems of varying magnitude that happen over the of a clinical trial they can affect patient safety data integrity or other aspects of the trial and need to be appropriately categorized and reported you and your team need to be prepared to recognize document and respond to every type of protocol event
types of protocol events roles and responsibilities additional resources

<DOC>regulatory affairs and trial misconduct
about regulatory affairs in clinical trials and how to avoid trial misconduct which is handled differently from protocol events trial investigators are held to federal and local standards in their study conduct and institutional review boards irbs along with federal agencies are in charge of enforcement the ramifications for trial investigators engaging in fraud or trial misconduct can result in loss of funding or even legal consequences so you and your team need to be aware of these expectations and plan for strict compliance throughout your trial

<DOC>standardization transparency and research reproducibility
be discussing standardization of research practices transparency of study activities and research reproducibility standardization improves dissemination of results easing the possibility of selective reporting between trials and facilitating a complete view of the full body of evidence standards for research practice enable study replication allowing other investigators to duplicate your results for verification purposes transparency allows for effective adjudication by journal editors and others who might wish to review your study data finally protocol development and trial registries hold the investigators to the they prespecified in their protocol development

<DOC>evidence synthesis introduction to systematic reviews and metaanalysis
about addressing a clinical trial question of interest by synthesizing evidence from various trials a systematic review focuses on a specific question and systematic reviewers use explicit transparent and replicable scientific methods to identify select appraise and summarize similar but separate studies metaanalysis is an optional component of systematic reviews that allows quantitative assessments of from similar trials
