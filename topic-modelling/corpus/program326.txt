resources and access in the cloud
this section explores how resources get organized with and how access to those resources gets shared with the right part of a workforce through a tool called identity and access management iam its also section that we identify different ways to interact with google cloud
google cloud resource hierarchy identity and access management iam service accounts cloud identity interacting with google cloud coursera getting started with google cloud platform and qwiklabs

virtual machines and networks in the cloud
this section of the explores how google compute engine works with a focus on virtual networking
virtual private cloud networking compute engine scaling virtual machines important vpc compatibilities cloud load balancing cloud dns and cloud cdn connecting networks to google vpc

storage in the cloud
this section of the showcases five core google cloud storage products cloud storage bigtable cloud sql spanner and firestore
google cloud storage options cloud storage cloud storage storage classes and data transfer cloud sql spanner firestore bigtable comparing storage options

containers in the cloud
this section of the explores containers and how they can be managed with kubernetes and google kubernetes engine
introduction to containers kubernetes google kubernetes engine

applications in the cloud
the focus of this section of the is developing applications in the cloud its here that well explore cloud run and cloud functions
cloud run development in the cloud

prompt engineering
this section looks at generative ai tools how they well explore how to combine google cloud knowledge with prompt engineering to improve gemini responses


final section we review what was presented and discuss the next steps to continue your cloud journey

security best practices in google cloud
this selfpaced training gives participants broad study of security controls and techniques on google cloud through recorded lectures demonstrations and handson labs participants explore and deploy the components of a secure google cloud solution including cloud storage access control technologies security keys customersupplied encryption keys api access controls scoping shielded vms encryption and signed urls it also covers securing kubernetes environments

welcome to security best practices in google cloud
welcome to security best practices in google cloud we will build upon the foundations laid during the earlier series managing security in google cloud section expect to more about how to implement security best practices to lower the risk of malicious attacks against your systems software and data

securing compute engine techniques and best practices
we will start with a discussion of service accounts iam roles and api scopes as they apply to compute engine we will also discuss managing vm logins and how to use organization policies to set constraints that apply to all resources in your organizations hierarchy next we will review compute engine best practices to give you some tips for securing compute enginelastly we will cover encrypting persistent disks with customersupplied encryption keys
overview service accounts iam roles and api scopes lab intro configuring using and auditing vm service accounts and scopes getting started with google cloud and qwiklabs connecting to virtual machines connecting to vms without external ips os login organization policy controls shielded vms confidential vms authority service what authority service provides compute engine best practices review

securing cloud data techniques and best practices
we discuss controlling iam permissions and access control lists on cloud storage buckets auditing cloud data including finding and remediating data that has been set to publicly accessible how to use signed cloud storage urls and signed policy documents and encrypting data at rest in addition bigquery iam roles and authorized views will be covered to demonstrate managing access to datasets and tables the will conclude with an overview of storage best practices
