ethics in the age of ai
as machine models begin making important decisions based on massive datasets we need to be aware of their limitations we will explore the rise of algorithms fundamental issues of fairness and bias in machine and basic concepts involved in security and privacy of machine well finish with a study of that will allow you to put your new into actionapplied projectai ethics research is an emerging field and to prove our we need to demonstrate our critical thinking and analytical ability since its not reasonable to jump into a full research paper with our newly founded we will instead on that will demonstrate your ability to analyze ethical ai across a variety of topics and situations

artificial intelligence privacy and convenience
we will explore fundamental concepts involved in security and privacy of machine diving into the ethics behind these decisions we will explore how to protect users from privacy violations while creating useful predictive models we will also ask big questions about how businesses implement algorithms and how that affects user privacy and transparency now and in the future

privacy and convenience vs big data
in we are going to discuss what true anonymity and privacy mean in machine
introduction how safe is your data algorithms vs privacy adversarial attacks on privacy weekly review

protecting privacy theories and methods
in we are going to take a deeper look at dataset security we will also look into methods to add privacy to existing and new datasets to protect those individuals in them
how secure is your model noise vs signal protecting privacy implementing differential privacy weekly review

building transparent models
in we will discuss putting ethical private models into practice we will explore the explainable ai movement as well as tradeoffs for the teams putting together these algorithms
privacy methods in practice glass box vs black box models markets and game theory empowering users deconstructing algorithmic complexity weekly review

artificial intelligence data fairness and bias
we will explore fundamental issues of fairness and bias in machine as predictive models begin making important decisions from college admission to loan decisions it becomes paramount to keep models from making unfair predictions from human bias to dataset awareness we will explore many aspects of building more ethical models

fairness and protections in machine
welcome to the in one we will be discussing what fairness means in the context of machine and what true parity means in different scenarios
introduction model parity a balancing act protecting groups protecting individuals imperfect modeling weekly review

building fair models theory and practice
we will take action against unfairness now that we have an understanding of fairness issues how do we build models that do not violate them
algorithms inside of algorithms getting to fair testing in theory fair loan decisions deploying fairness combating bias in practice adversarial models wordvec weekly review

human factors minimizing bias in data
we will tackle the human biases that enter the data collection and attribute selection processes the goal removing bias before the model is built
getting out of your head bias awareness building an exploratory training set imperfect modeling finding a balance human factors game theory weekly review

artificial intelligence algorithms models and limitations
we live in an age increasingly dominated by algorithms as machine models begin making important decisions based on massive datasets we need to be aware of their limitations in the real world whether its making loan decisions or rerouting traffic machine models need to accurately reflect our shared values we will explore the rise of algorithms from the most basic to the fullyautonomous and discuss how to make them more ethically sound

getting started algorithms
welcome to the were going to get started with an overview of the structure as well as an introductory look at the world of algorithms
introduction introduction sorting functions and data you as a dataset weekly review

ai and model
we are going to dive into predictive modeling the core differences in theory and practice
programming the out of the lab models in production weekly review

rules for ai training and constraints
we are going to focus on machine accuracy and training guidelines in the quest for more accurate and ethical models
modeling structure accuracy and bias mirrors training models with real data weekly review

ethical ai cause and effect
in our final were going to ask some big questions about where all this predictive intelligence leads we will discuss the trajectory of artificial intelligence and the broader implications for society as well
machines a future look ai balancing morals and profit impact and control preparing for agi weekly review

artificial intelligence ethics in action
ai ethics research is an emerging field and to prove our we need to demonstrate our critical thinking and analytical ability since its not reasonable to jump into a full research paper with our newly founded we will instead on that will demonstrate your ability to analyze ethical ai across a variety of topics and situations these include all the youve learned ai ethics

introduction
welcome to the capstone get to know a little bit about the we will be tackling section

openai gpt analysis
examining bias in a predictive text model

alleghany screening analysis
understanding fairness issues with sensitive predictions

game theory algorithm design
predicting ethical issues before they arise in model theory
