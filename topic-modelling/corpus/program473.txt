game development and prototyping
be introduced to game development and prototyping for games courses are highly recommended while courses create the foundational unreal engine project assets and code used throughout this this requires no previous and aimed at beginners
this explores different game modes stealth survival platformer capture the flag action combat crafting and story this will include a preproduction phase where learners will break down the design of each mode using obsidian understanding the core gameplay each mode is intended to design this preproduction phase will not only outline gameplay features but also how you can reuse assets and code for quick prototyping after preproduction there is a dedicated to creating each game mode this will include game modespecific code design and iteration by the end of this package your project to be in a visually presentable format for your portfolio

preproduction
this is all about planning before a game begins there are numerous decisions that you need to think about it is important to seek out games that are similar in design look for success and failure stories from developer interviews our industry loves to share knowledge through convention talks dev logs on youtube and through communities like discord during preproduction it is important to identify your early goals for development and in phases dont try to fully build specific features always focus on the core game loop it is important to keep it in specific design targets where you can take a moment and play what you are making from there you can adjust iterate and further understand your project progression
game development and prototyping introduction preproduction obsidian game mode references scope stealth survival scope platformer scope action combat scope capture the flag scope crafting scope story scope shared systems converting scope to level design tasks converting scope to system tasks preproduction review

implementation
implement all the game mechanics we need to start prototyping each game mode create specific features that we can enable or disable for our game design needs this is built to give you a broad understanding on how to implement mechanics and systems in the future

game modes
it is time to put everything youve learned to the test everything from all the way through to be tasked to design one of each game mode stealth survival platformer capture the flag action combat crafting and story understanding game design for multiple genres is part of creating innovative new ideas when two seemingly opposite genres get combined together it sparks something new try to take a loose approach at what you create think about the ambience for your level decide what game mechanics do you choose to keep or improve for each game mode
game modes stealth survival platformer capture the flag action combat crafting story game modes review

reflection
your final project for is to design a small game with complete creative freedom try to keep it simple think about one two or three core gameplay mechanics to focus on your designs should focus on supporting those features perhaps one of your previous game modes sparked your interest and you can take it to the next level by expanding it further you can try combining different game genres that you rarely see used together maybe there is a game type that wasnt discussed that you are really interested in prototyping use obsidian to plan your designs and scope accordingly look for references and complete research on similar genres your limits are only bound to your imagination

blueprint scripting
the blueprint visual scripting system in unreal engine is a visual programming language that uses a nodebased interface to create gameplay elements the nodebased workflow provides designers with a wide range of scripting concepts and tools that are generally only available to programmers in addition blueprintspecific markup available in unreal engines c implementation provides programmers with a way to create baseline systems that designers can extend this is primarily aimed at first and secondyear undergraduates interested in engineering or science along with high school students and professionals with an interest in programming
this introduces learners to the blueprint visual scripting system participants will blueprint basics how they relate to c and blueprint programming principles and will use their knowledge to create an interactive door for a game this does not require learners to have any previous knowledge about blueprint scripting to get started it is recommended that the learner take courses through before starting this

introduction to visual scripting with blueprints
learners will be introduced to blueprints unreal engines visual programming language that uses a nodebased interface to create gameplay elements
introduction blueprint interface blueprints as designer tools strengths and limitations of blueprints reading nodes components relationship between blueprints and c functions and variables variable types inheritance logic and flow control making a door timelines moving the door locking and unlocking event dispatchers construction script infinite loops timers challenge intro door direction

blueprint communication
about traces the way that blueprints communicate with each other in unreal engine and combine traces and triggers to build additional interactive elements for a game
traces trace types trace channel object traces single and multi traces hit results interfaces inputs print string overlaps casting trigger class button trigger lever trigger challenge intro elevator

characters controls and cameras
learners will be introduced to actors pawns and characters and how to utilize input actions to communicate between the input system and their projects code an input action can be anything that an interactive character might do like jumping or opening a door or it can be used to indicate user input states like holding a button that changes walking movement to running learners will create their own custom logic for a game character
character class player controller crouching control rotation camera and spring arm switching cameras enhanced input actions triggers and modifiers

creating mechanics
learners will be introduced to how create mechanics in games and devise their own solutions for gameplay this will include completing a simplified inventory system and management of said system
